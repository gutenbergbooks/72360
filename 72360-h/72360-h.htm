  <h2 class='c009'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>The basis of most of these chapters is composed
of letters contributed during the current year
to the <cite>Morning Post</cite>, by whose kind permission they
are here republished. They reflect the fleeting ideas,
the passing moods of the moment; but as the
various moments of which they reflect some kind of
image form part of what must constitute an eventful
chapter of Russian history, I have thought that
it would be worth while to republish them, so as to
furnish some kind of record of what people were
thinking and saying while the interesting things—which
history will relate—were happening, and so
as to give a few sidelights showing the attitude of
“the man in the street,” during the hours of crisis.
Such sidelights tend to show how little even the
greatest crises in the lives of States affect the daily
life of the average man. The people who cry out
that the state of things is intolerable and not to be borne
are, for the most part, well-to-do people who work
up their indignation towards the end of a good dinner.
The people who to the far-off looker-on seem to be
undergoing intolerable oppression are themselves
lookers-on, and they scarcely look, hardly realise and
seldom say anything.</p>

<p class='c011'>I have endeavoured in these chapters to present
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>impartially the widely divergent points of view of
various people; at the same time I have made no
attempt to disguise the whereabouts of my sympathies,
being mindful of the sage, who, as Renan translates
him, says: “Ne sois pas trop juste, et n’affecte pas trop
de sagesse de peur d’être un niais.”</p>

<p class='c011'>These sidelights being the reflections of fugitive
phases, I have made no attempt to introduce an
element of consistency into them, nor have I in the
light of subsequent events tried to modify the effect
of the hopes which proved to be illusory or of the fears
which were groundless—hopes and fears which I myself
shared with those by whom I heard them expressed.</p>

<p class='c011'>To those who take a serious interest in the Russian
evolution I would suggest two valuable books, “The
Crisis in Russia,” by Professor Milioukov (London:
Fisher Unwin, 1905), and “La Crise Russe,” by
Maxime Kovalevsky (Paris: Giard &#38; E. Brière,
16, Rue Souflot, 1906).</p>

<p class='c011'>“Modern Customs and Ancient Laws of Russia,”
by the same author (Nutt, 1891), will be useful to
the student of the past history of Russia. Nor can
one too often recommend “L’Empire des Tsars,” by
M. Leroy-Beaulieu. Sir Donald Mackenzie Wallace’s
work on Russia needs no recommendation. All
these books, which deal with the past of Russia, will
help the student to understand what is happening
at present; for without some knowledge of the past
history of Russia, what is now taking place cannot but
be incomprehensible.</p>

  <h2 class='c009'>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>This book is nothing else but a collection of
notes, a bundle of impressions gathered during
a year’s stay in Russia. It lays no claim to be either
exhaustive or even of any practical use to the serious
student of the Russian Evolution. It is written for
the ignorant, and with the object of helping them
to decide whether they wish to take an interest in
what is now happening in Russia, or not. I cannot
take them into the house and show them all over it
from floor to ceiling with the knowledge and authority
of a master-builder; all I can do is to open a small
window and ask them to look through it and observe
certain things, pointing out how far these things are
typical of the whole; and my hope is that the glimpses
I have given them will enable them to decide whether
they wish to go and knock at the front door and
investigate for themselves.</p>

<p class='c011'>This book consists solely of a record of things I have
seen and heard myself in Russia during an interesting
year of the history of that country. My experience of
English opinion on Russian things has convinced me
that in order to make such a record as intelligible as
possible, a great deal of introduction and explanation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>would be necessary. The reason of this is that the
ignorance in England about Russia is extraordinary;
and most of the current literature—I mean the books
published on Russian affairs—instead of dispelling that
ignorance, succeed rather in increasing it. Russia and
Russian affairs are so little known in England that
the country has proved a happy hunting ground for
sensational writers of fiction and still more sensational
purveyors of facts. Leaving the writers of fiction out
of the question, the chief bar which seems to separate
writers about Russia from a just estimate and a valuable
appreciation of that country is the language. It is
possible to convey information about Russia if you are
ignorant of the Russian language; and such information
may prove to be not only useful, but of surprising
interest to people who are totally ignorant of the
country. But unless you are acquainted with the
Russian language it is impossible to acquire an intimate
knowledge of the Russian people, and it is difficult to
understand many things which happen in Russia.</p>

<p class='c011'>I had, therefore, the intention, before proceeding to a
record of any things I had seen myself, to collect and
convey the impressions I had received of the Russian
character and of Russian life in various classes, correcting
and illustrating my impressions by those of others
who have worked in the same field, and by evidence
drawn from Russian literature. I meant to try and
illustrate books by examples taken from life, and throw
light on events and people by examples taken from
literature; but I found when I began to do this that
the writing of such an introduction was equivalent to
the writing of two large books, one on the Russian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xv'>xv</span>people and one on Russian literature, a task which
I still hope to accomplish some day, but for which I
do not at present feel sufficiently equipped. Moreover,
even were I sufficiently equipped, the writing of two
such books cannot be accomplished in a hurry in
a country which is in a state of political effervescence.
I have therefore sadly resigned myself to work backwards,
and give to the public my record of raw facts
first and the explanation at a later date.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nevertheless in giving this collection of scraps to
the public I still have an aim and a purpose. As I
have said, Englishmen are amazingly ignorant of
Russia; not only because they deliberately prefer the
works of sensation-mongers to those of really well-informed
writers like Sir D. M. Wallace or M. Leroy-Beaulieu,
but also because, when they honestly seek
for truth in the newspapers which are by way of being
serious, they are almost invariably misled. On the other
hand Englishmen who live in Russia, even if only for a
short period—such as officers from the Indian Army who
come out on leave to learn the language—find no difficulty
in forming a just appreciation of the country and
its people. It has always struck me that if any such
person were to write a record of what he saw and
thought, that record would have a real value because
it would constitute an aspect of the truth and not
an aspect of the lie. This is therefore my aim, and
it is the only merit I claim for this work. It contains
aspects of things, seen by some one whose object
was to try and understand the ordinary and not to
invent the extraordinary. And therefore, although my
work has no sort of claim to be taken seriously, either
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvi'>xvi</span>as history, or as a manual of useful information, it will
have the negative merit of being free from any attempt
at sensationalism, and, I hope, the positive merit of
containing some aspects of the truth, some unvarnished
record of <i><span lang="fr">la chose vue</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>If what I have written leads others to take an interest
in Russia and to go and see for themselves, and
to treat exhaustively in a masterly fashion the things at
which I have hinted incompletely and haltingly, I shall
feel amply rewarded.</p>

<p class='c011'>Somebody might object that even if we are totally
ignorant of Russia in England there is no great harm
done, that Russia is a far-off country with an impossibly
difficult language; why should we bother about it? To
this I would reply that the British people have shown
themselves to be gravely concerned about the increasing
competition with which the Englishman has to contend
in all branches of life, and at the alarming improvement
in the methods of his neighbours, which is met by no
similar improvement at home. British trade, British
influence, are rapidly, it is said, being outstripped.
Remedies, such as protection, are suggested. As to
whether such a remedy would prove efficacious or not I
have no idea; but one practical reason of our stagnation
in certain matters cannot fail to strike the most indolent
observer. Our neighbours are well and practically
educated. We are not. Is not this fact the cause of a
great many things? If we want to remedy an evil
we must look for the cause. I firmly believe that the
unpractical education which is given to so many of us is
largely responsible for the comparative stagnation of
Englishmen in matters of trade and enterprise, compared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvii'>xvii</span>with the sedulous efforts of the citizens of other countries.
I am not advocating the introduction of a purely continental
system of education, nor would I like to see
our system of athletics disappear; but it is obvious that
there is not and never will be any danger of either of
these two things happening. But I never mean to
lose an opportunity of advocating a radical reform in
the old-fashioned strictly classical education given and
received at our public schools and rendered necessary
by the obstinacy of our universities, owing to which
Greek and Latin are taught (but no longer learned
except by a slender minority), to the exclusion of all
other useful knowledge.</p>

<p class='c011'>The mass of boys who now learn nothing because
Greek and Latin mean nothing to them, would gladly
assimilate something which would be useful to them
in after life: for instance, some smattering of their
own history, some mastery of the English tongue, or
the knowledge of a modern language.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is no country where the disadvantage at
which an Englishman finds himself compared to his
continental rivals is made so plain as in Russia. In
Russia there is, and there will be even more in the
future, an immense field for foreign enterprise. The
Germans have taken, are taking, and will take the
utmost advantage of this fact. The English are content
to send advertisements here, written in the English
language, and never dream of trying to learn Russian
themselves.</p>

<p class='c011'>A working knowledge of the Russian language is
acquired here by the average British officer, working
for an examination, in the course of six months.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xviii'>xviii</span>Therefore this difficulty, though serious, is not insurmountable.
This, then, is the practical reason which I
advance for the furthering of knowledge about Russia.
I say that such knowledge is useful and advantageous
to Englishmen. I have another reason for wishing such
knowledge to be propagated, which is personal and
moral, but not sentimental. It is this. I confess that I
entertain perhaps a foolish desire for goodwill among
nations. Of course I know very well that rivalries and
conflicts must exist. Sometimes such rivalries and conflicts
are the result of a fundamental antagonism and
of the struggle for existence. But sometimes they are
merely the outcome of misunderstanding and prejudice.</p>

<p class='c011'>One of the wickedest things which shelters itself
under the holy name of patriotism is the spirit which
stirs up such prejudice and incites one country against
another groundlessly by playing on ignorance and popular
passion. With regard to Russia this has been done
with considerable success. So far from considering
such action to be patriotic, I consider it to be criminal;
and although it may not be of the slightest interest to
any one to hear this opinion expressed, to express it
is a pleasure which I cannot deny myself. Whatever
faults this book may contain, I mean to make up for
the disappointments which it has caused me by indulging
to the full in the luxury of saying exactly what I think in
its pages. I cannot, unfortunately, hope to be among
those masters who, speaking with inspired authority and
unerring skill, compel the crowd to listen to their message,
and at the sound of whose clarion-like utterance
the “forts of folly” fall to the ground like the walls
of Jericho. Mine is a humbler task, a more inglorious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xix'>xix</span>ambition. I hope to be like an obscure mouse who
nibbles in the darkness at the net which holds the lion
captive. The mouse in his lifelong effort succeeds
perhaps only in gnawing away a little; and I shall
be content if I succeed in nibbling through the most
tenuous thread of this great net of error, misunderstanding,
and falsehood. There are other mice who
will come after me, and who knows? perhaps one day
the lion will be set free.</p>

<p class='c011'>Finally, if it be asked from what point of view I
approach my study of Russia, I would answer that I
have no political views whatever in the matter; I have
tried to make it my business to discover, understand,
and explain the points of view of the people with whom
I have met; with some of these views I sympathise,
with others I do not. I have already said that I have
not disguised my sympathies, but I have attempted
to understand even what repelled me; my attitude
is that of a sympathetic friend, for whether the Frenchman
who said “L’intelligence est presque toujours la
sympathie” was right or wrong, I am convinced that
the converse is true, and that the spirit of carping is
nearly related to stupidity.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>I left St. Petersburg this evening for Manchuria.

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>I started for Irkutsk on the 9th from Moscow. The
train is crowded with people—officers going to the war,
men of business going to Siberia, women and children.
It is exceedingly hot. The last time I travelled in this
Trans-Siberian express the winter had just given way
to the leafless and bare aspect of early spring. Now
we travel through great stretches of green plains, past
huge fir-woods which are burnt and browned by the
heat. The topic of the peace negotiations continues
to prevail above all other topics. I am constantly
asked my opinion. We have just received the latest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>telegrams from Portsmouth. A man of business asked
me if I thought there would be peace. I said “Yes.”
“There won’t be,” he replied. The railway line is
fringed all the way with pink flowers, which, not being
a botanist, I take to be ragged robin. At night the
full moon shines spectral and large over the dark trees
and marshes, and every now and then over stretches
of shining water. The officers discuss the war from
morning till night. They abuse their generals mercilessly.
They say that it is impossible for Russians to
look foreigners in the face. In my compartment there
is an army doctor. He assisted at the battle of Mukden
and is now returning for the second time to the war.
He tells me that he wrote a diary of his experiences
during the battle and that he is unable to re-read it
now, so poignantly painful is the record. He trusts
there will not be peace. He is sanguine as to the
future. He loathes the liberal tendencies in Russia
and detests Maxim Gorki. Yet he is no Jingo.</p>

<p class='c011'>A gentleman from Moscow, and his wife, on the
contrary, inveigh bitterly against the Government and
the war. (I saw these same people again at Moscow
after the December rising. Their house was situated
in a street where the firing had been heavy and
abundant. They had had enough of revolution and
blamed the revolutionaries as severely then as they
now blamed the Government.) We constantly pass
trains full of troops going to the war. The men all
ask the same question: “When is peace going to be?”
They ask for newspapers and cigarettes. I gave
some of them some bottles of whisky, which they
drank off then and there out of the bottle. An
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>amusing incident happened last evening. We had
stopped at a siding. Everybody had got out of the
train. I was walking up and down the platform with
one of the passengers. We saw a soldier throwing
big stones at the window of the washing compartment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What are you doing that for?” we asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I want to speak to his Honour,” the soldier said;
“he is washing his face in the washing-room.” And
through the window of the compartment, lit by electric
light, we could see the silhouette of an officer washing
his face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why don’t you go and knock at the door?” we
asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“They are” (to speak of a person in the third person
plural is respectful in Russian, and is always done by
inferiors of their superiors)—“they are ‘having taken
drink’ (<em>Oni Vipimshi</em>),” he replied, and then he added,
lest we should receive a false impression, “His Honour
is very good.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As we passed train after train of troops I reflected
on the rashness of prophecy. How often I had heard
it said in London, when the war broke out, that the
line would break down immediately. Even when I
reached Mukden I heard people say that the line
could not possibly last through the summer, and
here it is supporting gaily train after train in the
second year of the war.</p>

      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>On the way to Chita</span>, <em>August 20th</em>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>We arrived at Irkutsk on the morning of the 17th
and took the train for Baikal. At Irkutsk station
there was a train of sick soldiers returning from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>war. They begged for newspapers. The tedium of
their long journey is, they say, intolerable. They
say there has been a good deal of typhus in Manchuria.</p>

<p class='c011'>We crossed the lake in the steamer. Its summer
aspect is far less striking than the strange glory which
it wears when it is frozen, and the distant mountains
seem like “a sunny pleasure dome with caves of ice.”
In summer the waters are blue, the nearer hills grey and
the distant mountains blue, but with nothing strange
or unreal about them. Yet when the sunset silvered
the grey tints and spread a ragged golden banner
in the sky, the lake was extremely beautiful in another
way. At Baikal station there was the usual struggle
for places in the train. How well I remembered the
desperate struggle I had gone through to get a seat
in a third-class carriage at this same place last year!
This time it was in the first-class carriage that the
conflict took place. An engineer got into the same
carriage as I did. He occupied one of the lower
berths and I the other. Presently a lady arrived,
bound for Chita, and looking for a place. She came
into our carriage and asked to be allowed to have
one of the lower berths. The engineer flatly refused
and said that he had occupied his seat and had a right
to keep it. I told her I would let her have mine with
pleasure. She occupied it and went out. I moved
my things into the upper berth. “Why on earth
did you give up your seat?” the engineer asked.
“You had a <em>right</em> to keep it.” When the lady came
back she said to me: “Ah! you are evidently not a
Russian; no Russian would have given up his place.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>The engineer turned out to be quite a good-natured
sort of person, but there is something about trains
which makes people who are by nature mild and
good-natured turn into savages, and instils into them
a passionate determination to cleave to their rights.
The next morning another man arrived in our carriage,
with a large basket and a second-class ticket.
This upset the engineer, who complained to the “Controller”
of the train, and the poor man was turned
out. The engineer snorted and said: “There’s an
insolent fellow for you.” The lady was the wife
of an engineer who was employed at Chita; and she
told me much about life in Chita: how hard times
were, owing to the war, how scarce food was getting—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span lang="la">Und wie so teuer der Kaffee,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la">Und wie so rar das Geld!</span>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The “Controller” of the train, an official in plain
clothes, whose exact duties I was not able to determine,
except that he was able to turn the second-class
passenger out of our carriage, spent a day
and a night with us. He and the engineer talked
without ceasing of the meetings of the Zemstva
all over the country; of the discontent of the public
servants and of the imminence of a strike. They told
me there would be a big railway strike, but I did not
pay much attention to this, nor did I in the least
realise the importance of what they were discussing.
In one of the second-class carriages I made friends
with two young officers who were going out to the
war as volunteers, and two ladies, one the wife of an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>officer already out there, and the other a hospital
nurse. With them also was the son of the officer’s
wife, a student from Odessa, who told me many interesting
things. He described to me in great detail
the mutiny of the Black Sea Fleet, and he prophesied,
if not a revolution, at least a great change in Russia
in the immediate future. One of the carriages of the
train was barred, and in it sat a political prisoner, a
schoolmaster from Irkutsk. Some of my friends went
to speak to him, but they came back in melancholy
and disappointment, since they said this prisoner was
hissing hatred and rage through the bars in an undignified
and painful manner.</p>

<p class='c011'>Soon after we left Baikal a young man joined us
who said he was employed in a firm at Chita. He had
brought with him some flowers from Irkutsk. These he
carried in a large basket full of wet sand. They were a
kind of pathetic stock but not “in fragrant blow”; poor,
feeble, starved and rather dirty flowers they were. But
in Transbaikalia flowers were rare, and he had paid 18
roubles, he said (£1 8s.), for this nosegay, and he was
bringing them to Chita as a gift to the girl to whom he
was engaged to be married. He looked after these
flowers with the utmost care; the basket was put in my
berth and, as it was full of water, a constant stream
trickled down from it and made a small pond on the
floor of the carriage.</p>

<p class='c011'>We are nearing Chita; the husband of the lady to
whom I gave my place has arrived to meet her and take
her home. He is an engineer. They are deeply engaged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>in discussing local politics. The husband talks
of a coming strike, and tells me that if I wish to see
political meetings I had better stay in Chita. There are
meetings every evening; some of them are dispersed by
the police. I now realise the importance of flowers in
this country; it is “a land of sand and ruin and gold.”
The young clerk has produced two perforated bouquetholders
(is there such a word?) and has carefully placed
the flowers in them, with a sigh of relief. They have
not quite faded, although they droop sadly. At Chita
the lady and her husband get out. The engineer also.
I am now alone in my carriage. Beyond Chita the
country is mountainous and fledged with fir-trees.</p>

<p class='c011'>The hilly country has ceased and we have once
more reached the flat plains. This morning the guard
brought a man into my carriage and asked me if I
minded his sitting there. I said I did not mind. I
offered him some tea. The man made no answer, and
looked at me with a vacant stare. Then the guard laid
him down at full length, and said, “This man is the
assistant station-master at Manchuria station. He is
drunk, but you need not be alarmed; he will be quite
quiet.” He was quiet; at Manchuria station he woke
up from his stupor automatically, as though from frequent
habit.</p>

<p class='c011'>We arrived at Manchuria station last night. The
chaos that always reigns there is terrific. I had the
utmost difficulty in obtaining permission to continue my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>journey. The officials said I needed an extra paper,
besides those I had with me, from the Chief of the Staff in
Kharbin. The initial difficulty was to get one’s ticket,
as the crowd was dense and long. What quantities of
people seem to be drawn to Manchuria, like filings to a
magnet! An officer got me my ticket, and just when I
had utterly despaired of being able to travel further, the
gendarme brought me my permission to proceed. Then
came the struggle for a place in a third-class carriage.
This was successfully got through. I obtained an
upper berth across the window. The compartment is
crammed with people.</p>

<p class='c011'>We are travelling through the hills of northern
Manchuria. News has arrived of the summoning of a
new Duma. Now people say there will not be peace,
and the war will become a national war because it will
have the consent of the people. Others contest this;
there are hot discussions. I have moved into a second-class
carriage in which there is a photographer and a
captain. I had my fortune told with cards by a lady in
the train. She said I should soon meet a lot of friends
and experience a change of fortune for the better.</p>

<p class='c011'>We arrived at Kharbin the day before yesterday.
The town seems to have got much bigger than when I
left it last year. The climate has not improved, nor have
the prices at the hotel diminished. I have already met
some old friends of last year at the bank and at the
staff. There is a new restaurant opposite the bank,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>where a band plays the overture to “William Tell”
without ceasing. Kharbin is empty. It appears that
Linievitch does not allow officers to come here except
on pressing errands. I dislike Kharbin more than any
place I have ever seen in the world. The one topic is,
of course, the peace negotiations. The matter is hotly
discussed; some are in favour of peace, others
vehemently against it. The news is contradictory. I
have asked for leave to go to the front. I shall have to
wait some days before I receive it.</p>

from the staff, where they told him that news had been

peace. Orders had come to dispatch everything available
to the front with all possible speed and to get ready
for an offensive movement.</p>

<p class='c011'>I arrived at Gonchuling yesterday. Gonchuling is
now what Mukden used to be before the battle of
Mukden was fought. It consists of dozens and dozens
of small grey brick houses, with slate roofs, on one side
of the line, and on the other side of the line is a small
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Chinese town. The Military Attachés are here in their
car. I am living with the Press Censors. People talk
about peace as if it was not yet a fact. An officer,
whose wife I met in the train coming out, has been sent
to fortify positions. Kouropatkin’s army is said to have
received orders to advance. People express doubts as
to whether the peace will be ratified, and there is talk of
a revolution in Japan.</p>

<p class='c011'>I have the intention of joining the 2nd Transbaikal
Cossack battery, with which I lived last year. I have

large Chinese town of Jen-tzen-tung on the Mongolian
frontier. I started from Godziadan at eight
o’clock in the morning on the 11th, when I found two
Cossacks waiting for me, with a third pony for me
to ride, saddled with my own English saddle, which
I had left behind me last year. As we started one
of the Cossacks said: “You must be careful with that
pony, he throws himself.” I wondered what this
meant; whether the pony ran away, or bit, or kicked,
or stumbled, or bucked, or fell, my experience of
Chinese ponies being that they do all these things. I
was not long in finding out; it meant that the pony
took a sort of dive forward every now and then, tearing
the skin off one’s fingers in the effort to hold it up.</p>

<p class='c011'>After we had ridden for about two hours, one of the
Cossacks asked the other if he knew the way. The
other answered that he did not. The first one told
him he was a fool. “But,” I interrupted, “as you have
just come from Jen-tzen-tung, surely you know the
way back.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>“Oh!” they answered, “we came by quite a different
way along the lines. But, <em>nichevo</em>, it doesn’t matter.
We shall get there somehow.” We stopped for
luncheon at an encampment of the Red Cross. I
was entertained by the doctors and the hospital nurses.
They expressed the most bitter and violently revolutionary
sentiments. After luncheon we went on,
asking the way of the Chinese in each village, our
destination for the evening being the large town of
Oushitai. At every village we asked, the Chinese
answered by telling us how many lis (a li is 1⅓ of a
mile) Oushitai was distant, and the accuracy with which
they determined the distance was, as far as I could
judge, amazing. We arrived at Oushitai at moonrise.
We went into a yard where there was tea, and straw
to lie on, and provisions, but the Cossacks refused to
stay there because there were “soldiers” there. The
Cossacks, being Cossacks and not “soldiers,” often
consider it beneath their dignity to mix with soldiers.
So we had to find another yard, where we drank tea
and slept until dawn the next morning, when we
started once more. We halted at midday in a small
Chinese village for our midday meal. It was a small,
rather tumble-down village, with a large clump of
trees near it. A Chinaman came out of a house, and
seeing the red correspondent’s badge on my arm,
asked me if I was a doctor. To save the bother of
explanation I said I was a doctor. Then he conveyed
the information in pidgin-Russian that his son was ill,
and requested me to cure him. I went into the house
and he showed me a brown and naked infant with
a fat stomach. I made him put out his tongue. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>was white. I asked what he had been eating lately.
The Chinaman said raw Indian corn. I prescribed
cessation of diet and complete repose. The Chinaman
appeared to me to be much satisfied, and asked me if
I would like to hear a concert. I said very much.
Then he bade me sit down on the khan—the natural
divan of every Chinese house—and to look (“<em>smotrì,
smotrì</em>” he said). Presently another Chinaman came
into the room and, taking from the wall a large and
twisted clarion (like the wreathed horn old Triton blew),
he blew on it one deafening blast and hung it up on
the wall again. There was a short pause, I waited
in expectation, and the Chinaman turned to me and
said: “The concert is now over.”</p>

<p class='c011'>I then went to have luncheon with the Cossacks
under the trees. The luncheon consisted of hard rusks
(hard as bricks), made of black bread, swimming in an
earthen bowl of boiling water on the top of which tea
was sprinkled. When we had finished luncheon, and
just as we were about to resume our journey, the
Chinaman in whose house I had been entertained
rushed up to me and said: “In your country, when
you go to a concert, do you not pay for it?” The
concert was paid for and then we started once more to
ride along the mountainous roads, a flat green country,
with few trees, and great pools of water caused by
recent rain, through which we had to wade and
sometimes to swim. Towards the afternoon the aspect
of the country changed; we reached grassy and flowery
steppes. It was the beginning of the Mongolian country.
We met Mongols sitting sideways on their ponies, and
dressed in coats of many colours. I have never felt quite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>so tired in my life as while that interminable afternoon
wore on. The distance from Godziadan to Jen-tzen-tung
is eighty miles, and when the sun set, and the Cossacks
announced that after arriving at Jen-tzen-tung we
should have to ride yet two miles further to find the
battery, I inwardly resolved that no force on earth
should make me ride another inch that night. We
arrived at Jen-tzen-tung at eight o’clock in the evening.
There I found my old friend Kizlitzki, of the battery,
who, as usual, was living by himself in Chinese quarters
of immaculate cleanliness. His servant being the
former cook of the battery who used every day to make
“Boeuf Stroganoff,” Kizlitzki gave me an excellent
dinner and a most comfortable bed. The next
morning I rode to the village, two miles distant, where
the battery was quartered, and here I found all my
old friends: Glinka, the doctor, Hliebnikoff, and others.</p>

<p class='c011'>The house is a regular Chinese house, or series of
one-storeyed houses forming a quadrangle, in which
horses, donkeys, and hens disport themselves. We
occupy one side of the house. Opposite us the owner
lives. In the evening one hears music from the other
side. I went to see what it was; a Chinaman lying
on his back plays on a one-stringed lute, “und singt
ein Lied dabei, das hat eine wundersame gewaltige
Melodei.” Something like this:—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>The first question everybody asked me was whether
peace had been declared or not. There has been some
fighting here at the outposts since peace was declared.</p>

<p class='c011'>This village is exceedingly picturesque. It lies in
a clump of willow-trees and hard by there is a large
wood which stretches down to a broad and brown
river. Next to our quarters there is a small house
where an old Chinaman is preparing three young
students for their examination in Pekin. One of these
Chinamen came this morning and complained that
their house had been ruined by the Cossacks. We
went to inspect the disaster. It turned out that one
of the Cossacks had put his finger through one of the
paper windows of the house, making thereby a small
hole in it. The old teacher is quite charming. He
recited poetry to us. When the Chinese recite poetry
they half sing it. I had lately read a translation of
a Chinese poem by Li-Tai-Po, which in the translation
runs thus:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“You ask me what my soul does away in the sky;</div>
      <div class='line'>I inwardly smile but I cannot make answer;</div>
      <div class='line'>Like the peach blossom carried off by the stream,</div>
      <div class='line'>I soar away to a world unknown to you.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>By means of a small piece of wood, a flower, and
some water I made the Chinaman understand what
poem I was alluding to, and he recited it for us. The
Chinese asked me to tell them their fortunes by their
hands. I said to one of them, at random, that I saw
great riches in his hand, thinking it would please
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>him. The Chinaman said nothing, but later, when
this Chinaman, who was a visitor, had gone, the others
said to me: “You spoke true words. That man
is a ‘Koupeza’ (pidgin-Russian for merchant) and
he is enormously rich.” These Chinamen take an
acute interest in the result of the peace negotiations,
and wish to be informed as to all sorts of details
of which we are ignorant. The impression among
the officers here is that it is a very good thing that
peace has been concluded. “We ought to thank
Heaven that our men have not been beaten again,”
one of them said, and he added: “It is silly to say
that the higher authorities are the only guilty ones; we
are all equally guilty.”</p>

<p class='c011'>We spend the time riding, reading, bathing, sleeping,
and playing patiences.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jen-tzen-tung is a large and most picturesque town.
A constant stream of Mongols flows in and out of
it. They wear the most picturesque clothes, silks
and velvets of deep orange and luminous sea-green,
glowing like jewels. We ride into the town to buy
provisions, fish mostly. The wines sold at the shops
are all sham and horribly nasty. At the corner of
one of the streets there is a professional wizard, dressed
in black silk embroidered with silver moons, and
wearing the conical cap that wizards always do wear.
You ask a question, pay a small sum and shake coins
out of a cup three times, and according as the coins
make an odd or even figure, the wizard writes down a
sign on a piece of paper, and then he tells you the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>answer to your question. The Chinese consult him
before striking a bargain or setting out on a journey.
I asked him whether I should get back all right? He
answered that I could go home either by the East
or the West, and that the West would be better, though
I should meet with obstacles.</p>

<p class='c011'>He refused to prophesy for more than a hundred
days ahead.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the evening, after dinner, we discussed politics
and the Duma (that is to say the Duma as originally
planned by the decree of August 6th). The doctor
said that unless there were to be a constitution in
Russia, he would emigrate abroad, as he did not choose
that his children should be brought up in a country
which was politically inferior to Turkey. He is
hopeful about the Duma; he says Witte will be a
national hero; and that a constitution is a foregone
conclusion. Somebody said the peasants were hopeless.
He hotly contested this, and said there was far more
political sense among the peasants than among the
rest of the population. He has had great experience
of the peasants.</p>

<p class='c011'>I had a long talk with Kizlitzki this afternoon. He
is like a round peg in a square hole in this army.
Strict discipline and impeccable order seem to him
the first essentials of military life. The others don’t
understand this, although they are conscientious; but
they like doing things in their own way, which is a
happy-go-lucky way, and they think Kizlitzki is rather
mad. Kizlitzki told me that at the battle of Ta-shichiae,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>where he was in command of the battery, when
he had made all the necessary arrangements, placed
his guns, &#38;c., he received orders to go and speak to
a general; before he went, he warned his subordinates
to leave everything as it was. When he came back he
found that the battery, owing to the fancy of one of
the subordinates, had been moved two miles from
where he had placed it. So he had to fetch it back
and arrange everything over again. The result was
that it did not open fire until two in the afternoon,
a fact which I had noticed at the time, although
I was not with the battery then. He said he had
never made such an effort of self-control as not to
lose his temper when he saw what had been done.
In the French or German, and I trust also in our army,
Kizlitzki’s methods would be taken as a matter of
course. Here they are considered to be an unnecessary
pose. On the other hand he is not in the least a
formalist, a lover of red-tape, or a pedant; he merely
considers elementary discipline to be necessary.</p>

<p class='c011'>I had tea with a Chinese Mandarin. I do not know
which was the more exquisite, his tea or his manners.
In the evening we discussed writers of books. Hliebnikoff
said he knew who was the greatest writer in the
world, and when some one else asked who, he answered
Dostoievski of course. The doctor vehemently disagreed
with this. Hliebnikoff went out of the room in
disgust. It is astonishing what a quantity of English
novels these people have read in translations: Mrs.
Humphry Ward, Rider Haggard, Stevenson, Kipling,
Conan Doyle, Mark Twain, Jerome K. Jerome. The
doctor admires Jerome enormously. I think there is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>human element in him which especially appeals to
Russians.</p>

<p class='c011'>A fine, hot, and glorious September day. The
evening was one of those things that linger in one’s
mind like music. The sky was a very faint mauve,
something between mauve and pink, like a hydrangea,
or as Dante says:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>and, hanging over the delicate willow-trees, silvery in
the half-light and faintly rustling, a large and misty
moon—a moon made of ghostly fire. The days pass
in pleasant monotony; visitors come from other
divisions; but we go to bed about nine in the evening
and get up very early. It is a delicious life. We often
visit the Chinese professor in his peripatetic school.
One of the students asked me whether in my country
“you write and a big captain comes to look-see, and if
all was not well, beats you.” I said that practically
this was the procedure of our competitive examinations.</p>

<p class='c011'>I left for Gunchuling, <i><span lang="fr">en route</span></i> for Kharbin, with
Hliebnikoff and another, and bade goodbye to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>friends who had so hospitably entertained me. (Two
of them I was never to see again, for they died shortly
after I left, one of typhoid and one of dysentery.) We
arrived at Oushitai at five in the evening. The country
is said to be infested by Hung-Hutzes, and some men
were wounded by them yesterday in the environs of
this place. At Jen-tzen-tung I met a merchant, whom
I had known at Liaoyang, who had been caught by the
Hung-Hutzes, but—</p>

<p class='c011'>Jen-tzen-tung was on the extreme right flank of the
Russian army. The army therefore extended eighty
miles from the extreme right flank to the centre, and
again another eighty miles from the centre to the
extreme left flank. Oushitai was connected with
Gunchuling by a kind of tram-railway drawn by horses.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>My return journey from Kharbin to Moscow was
entirely uneventful until we arrived at Samara.
At Irkutsk I had got a place in the Trans-Siberian
express, which was crowded with all sorts and conditions
of men: officers, merchants, three Germans,
three Americans who had returned from working a
mine in Siberia, a Polish student, and some ladies.</p>

<p class='c011'>The first inkling that I received of the fact that a
revolution was going on in Russia came to me in the
following manner. We had crossed the Urals and had
only been travelling thirteen days. We had arrived
at Samara, when the attendant, who looked after the
first-class carriage, came into my compartment and
heaved a deep sigh. I asked him what was the matter.
“We shan’t get further than Toula,” he said. “Why?”
I asked. “Because of the unpleasantnesses” (<em>niepriyat
nosti</em>). I asked, “What unpleasantnesses?” “There is
a mutiny,” he said, “on the line.” We passed the big
station of Sisran and arrived at the small town of
Kouznetsk. There we were informed that the train
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>could not go any further because of the strike. Nobody
realised the extent of the strike, and we expected to go
on in a few hours. By the evening the passengers
began to show some signs of restlessness. Most of
them telegraphed to various authorities. A petition
was telegraphed to the Minister of Ways and Communications,
saying that an express train full of
passengers, overtired by a long and fatiguing journey,
was waiting at Kouznetsk, and asking him to be so
good as to arrange for them to proceed further. There
was no answer to this telegram. The next day a sense
of resignation seemed to come over the company.
Although every evening, towards dinner-time, one
heard innumerable complaints such as “only in Russia
could such a <em>bezobrazie</em> (literally an ugliness, <em>i.e.</em>, a
disgraceful thing) happen,” and one passenger suggested
that Prince Kilkoff’s portrait, which was hung in the
dining-car, should be turned face to the wall. The
Polish student, who had accompanied the Americans
and made music for them, playing by ear any tune
they whistled to him, and consequently a great many
tunes from the Gaiety repertoire, played the piano with
exaggerated facility and endless fioriture and runs.
I asked an American mechanic who was with the
mining managers whether he liked the music. He
said he would like it if the “damned hell” were
knocked out of it, which was exactly my feeling. But
on the second day after our arrival my American
friends left by road for Samara, to proceed thence by
water to St. Petersburg. The passengers spent the
time in exploring the town, which was somnolent and
melancholy in the extreme. Half of it was a typical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Russian village built on a hill, a mass of brown huts;
the other half, on the plain, was like a village in any
country. The idle guards and railway officials sat
on the steps of the station-room whistling. Two more
trains arrived: a sanitary train and an ordinary slow
passenger train.</p>

<p class='c011'>The passengers from these trains wandered about
the platform, mixing with the idlers from the town
population. A crowd of peasants and travellers,
engineers, and Red Cross attendants, soldiers, and
merchants sauntered up and down in loose shirts and
big boots, munching sunflower seeds and spitting
out the husks till the platform was thick with refuse.
A doctor who was in our train, and who was half a
German, with an official training and an orthodox
official mind, talked to the railway servants like a
father. It was very wrong to strike, he said. They
should have put down their grievances on paper and
had them forwarded by the proper channels. The
officials said that that would be waste of ink and
caligraphy. “I wonder they don’t kill him,” said my
travelling companion, and I agreed with him. Each
passenger was given a rouble a day to buy food. The
third-class passengers were given checks, in return
for which they could receive meals. However, they
deprecated the idea, and said that they wanted the
amount in beer. They received it. Then they looted
the refreshment room, broke the windows, and took
away the food. This put an end to the check system.
The feeling among the first-class passengers deepened.
Something ought to be done, was the general verdict;
but nobody quite knew what. They felt that the train
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>ought to be placed in a position of safety. The situation
on the evening of the second day began to resemble
that described in Maupassant’s masterpiece, “Boule de
Suif.” Nothing, however, could be done except to
explore the town of Kouznetsk. It was warm autumn
weather. The roads were soft and muddy, and there
was a smell of rotting leaves in the air. It was damp
and grey, with gleams of pitiful weak sunshine. In
the middle of the town was a large market-place where
a brisk trade in geese was carried on. One man whom
I watched failed to sell his geese during the day, and
while driving them home at night talked to them as
if they had been dogs, saying, “Cheer up, we shall soon
be home.” A party of convicts who belonged to the
passenger train were working hard by the station,
and implored the passing tribute of a sigh and a
cigarette. Both were freely given. Convicts in Russia
are always alluded to as “unfortunates.” I met them
near the station and they at once said, “Give the unfortunates
something.” In the evening, in one of the
third-class carriages, a party of Little Russians, assistants
in the Red Cross, sang songs in parts—melancholy,
beautiful songs, with a strange trotting rhythm
and no end and no beginning; and opposite their
carriage on the platform a small crowd of moujiks
gathered together and listened, saying that the men
sang with cunning (<em>lovko paiout</em>).</p>

<p class='c011'>On the morning of the fourth day after we had
arrived the impatience of the passengers increased to
fever pitch. A colonel who was with us, and who
knew how to use the telegraph, communicated with
Piensa, the next big station. For although the telegraph
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>clerks were on strike they remained in the office
conversing with their friends on the wire all over
Russia. The strikers were most affable. They said
they had not the slightest objection to the express
proceeding on its journey, that they would neither
boycott nor beat anybody who took us, and that if
we could find a friend to drive the engine, well and
good. We did. We found a friend, an amateur
engine-driver, and an amateur engine, and on the
28th of October we started for Piensa. We broke
down on the way. The engine-driver was supported
by public contributions. The moment the engine
stopped work all the passengers volunteered advice as
to how it should be mended, one man producing a
piece of string for the purpose. However, another
stray engine was found, and we arrived at last at
Piensa. There I saw mentioned in the telegrams the
words “rights of speech and assembly,” and I knew
that the strike was a revolution. At Piensa the rage
of the military—who had had their return journey
from the Far East delayed—against the strikers was
indescribable. They were lurching about the station
in a state of inebriate frenzy, using language about
strikes and strikers which is not fit to repeat. One
of them asked me if I was a striker. We stopped
at Piensa for the night. We started again the next
morning for Moscow, but the train came to a dead
stop at two o’clock the next morning at Riansk, and
when I woke up the first-class attendant came, with
many deep sighs, and said that we should go no further
until the unpleasantnesses were at an end. But an
hour later news came that we could go to Riazan in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>another train, which we did. Riazan station, when we
arrived, was guarded by soldiers. A train was ready
to start for Moscow, but the scuffle for places in it
was terrific. I found a place in a third-class carriage.
Opposite me was an old man with a grey beard. He
attracted my attention by the extraordinary courtesy
with which he prevented a woman, with many bundles,
from being turned out of the train by another moujik.
I asked him where he came from. “Eighty versts from
the other side of Irkutsk,” he said. “I was sent there,
and I am returning home now after thirteen years at
the Government’s expense. I was a convict.” “What
were you sent there for?” I asked. “Murder!” he
answered very gently. The other passengers asked
him to tell his story. “It’s a long story,” he said.
“Tell!” shouted the other passengers. His story
briefly was this: He had got drunk, set fire to a barn,
and when the owner interfered he had killed him. He
had served two years’ hard labour and eleven years’
banishment. He was a gentle, humble creature, with
a very mild expression, like an apostle in disguise.
He had no money, and lived on what other passengers
gave him. I gave him a cigarette. He smoked a
quarter of it and said he would keep the rest for the
journey, as he had still got five hundred versts to travel.
We arrived at Moscow at eleven o’clock in the evening
and found the town in darkness, save for the glimmer
of oil lamps. The next morning we woke up to find
that Russia had been given a Magna Charta; that the
railway and other officials had obtained the same concessions
from the Government as the Barons had won
from King John seven hundred years ago.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span><span class='sc'>Moscow</span>, <em>October 30th</em> (Old Style, <em>October 17th</em>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The first thing which brought home to me that
Russia had been granted the promise of a Constitution
was this. I went to the big Russian baths. Somebody
came in and asked for some soap, upon which the
barber’s assistant, aged about ten, said with the air of
a Hampden, “Give the ‘citizen’ some soap” (<em>Daite
grajdaninon mwilo</em>). Coming out of the baths I found
the streets decorated with flags, and everybody in a
state of frantic and effervescing enthusiasm. I went
to one of the big restaurants. There old men were
embracing each other and drinking the first glass of
vodka to free Russia. After luncheon I went out into
the Theatre square. There is a fountain in it, which
forms an excellent public platform. An orator mounted
it and addressed the crowd. He began to read the
Emperor’s Manifesto. Then he said: “We are all
too much used to the rascality of the Autocracy to
believe this; away with the Autocracy!” The crowd,
infuriated—they were evidently expecting an enthusiastic
eulogy—cried: “Away with you!” But instead
of attacking the speaker who had aroused their indignation
they ran away from him! It was a curious sight.
The spectators on the pavement were seized with panic
and ran too. The orator, seeing his speech had missed
fire, changed its tone and said: “You have misunderstood

This speaker was an ordinary Hyde Park orator, and
not to be confused with the University professors who
afterwards spoke from the same platform. Later in the
afternoon a procession of students arrived opposite
my hotel with red flags, and collected outside the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>Governor-General’s house. He appeared on the balcony
and made a speech, in which he said that now there
were no police he hoped that they would be able to
keep order themselves. He asked them also to replace
the red flag which was hanging on the lamp-post
opposite the palace by the national flag. One little
student climbed like a monkey up the lamp-post and
hung a national flag there, but did not remove the red
flag. Then the Governor asked them to sing the
National Anthem, which they did; and as they went
away they sang the Marseillaise.</p>

<p class='c011'>At one moment a Cossack arrived, but an official
came out of the house and told him he was not needed,
upon which he went away amidst the jeers, cheers,
hoots, and whistling of the crowd. The day passed
off quietly on the whole, the only untoward incidents

standing there, also explained that the “Black Gang”
consisted of roughs who supported the autocratic cause.

<p class='c011'>I went to see Maxim Gorki’s new play at the Artistic
Theatre of Moscow, “The Children of the Sun.” It
was the second night that it had been performed. M.
Stanislavoshi, one of the chief actors of the troupe and
the stage manager, gave me his place. The theatre
was crammed. There is a scene in the play, where
a doctor, living in a Russian village, and devoting his
life to the welfare of the peasants, is suspected of
having caused an outbreak of cholera. The infuriated
peasants pursue the doctor and bash some one on
the head. On the first night this scene had reduced
a part of the audience to hysterics. It was too
“actual.” People said we see enough of our friends
killed in the streets without going to the play for
such a sight. On the second night it was said that
the offensive scene had been suppressed. I did not
quite understand what had been eliminated. As I
saw the scene it was played as follows. A roar is
heard as of an angry crowd. Then the doctor runs
into a house and hides. The master of the house protests;
a peasant flies at his throat and half strangles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>him until he is beaten on the head by another peasant
who belongs to the house. The play is full of interesting
moments, and was played with the finished
perfection which makes this theatre famous and
unique. But M. Gorki has not M. Tchekoff’s talent
of representing on the stage the uneventful passage
of time, the succession of the seemingly insignificant
incidents of people’s everyday lives, chosen with such
skill, depicted with such an instinct for mood and
atmosphere that the result is enthrallingly interesting.
M. Gorki’s plays have the faults and qualities of his
stories. They are unequal, but contain moments of
poignant interest and vividness. I do not think, however,
that his gifts are pre-eminently suited for the stage.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>At dinner at the Métropole Restaurant a strange
scene occurred. At the end of dinner the band
played the Marseillaise, and after it the National
Anthem. Everybody stood up except one mild-looking
man with spectacles, who went on calmly eating his
dinner, upon which a man who was sitting at the

up to him and began to pull him about and drag him to

which proved effectual, and when he had finished his

<p class='c011'>The outward aspect of the town during these days
is strange. Moscow seems like a city which has
been undergoing a siege. Many of the shops have got
great wooden shutters. Some of the doors have a large
red cross on them. The distress, I am told, during the
strike was terrible. There was no light, no gas, no
water, all the shops were shut; provisions and wood
were scarce. This afternoon I went to see Bauman’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>funeral procession, which I witnessed from many parts
of the town. It was one of the most impressive sights
I have ever seen. A hundred thousand men took part
in it. The whole of the “Intelligenzia” (the professional
and middle class) was in the streets or at the windows.
The windows and balconies were crowded with people.
The order was perfect. There was not a hitch nor a
scuffle. The men walking in the procession consisted
of students, doctors, workmen, people in various kinds
of uniform. There were ambulances, with doctors
dressed in white in them, in case there should be casualties.
The men bore great red banners and the coffin was
covered with a scarlet pall. As they marched they sang
in a low chant the “Marseillaise,” “Viechni Pamiat,”
and the “Funeral March”<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c019'><sup>[1]</sup></a> of the fighters for freedom.
This last tune is the most impressive. From a musician’s
point of view it is a shockingly bad tune; but then, as
Du Maurier said, one should never listen to musicians
on the subject of music any more than one should listen
to wine merchants on the subject of wine. But it is the
tune which to my mind is exactly fitting for the Russian
revolution, with its dogged melancholy and invincible
passion, as fitting as the “Marseillaise” (which, by
the way, the Russian sings in parts and slowly) is
totally unfitting. The “Funeral March” has nothing
defiant in it; but it is one of those tunes which, when
sung by a multitude, make one’s flesh creep; it is commonplace
if you will; and it expresses—as it were by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>accident—the commonplaceness of all that is determined
and unflinching, mingled with an accent of weary
pathos. As it grew dark torches were brought out,
lighting up the red banners and the scarlet coffin of the
unknown veterinary surgeon, who in a second, by a
strange freak of chance, had become a hero, or rather a
symbol, an emblem and a banner, and who was being
carried to his last resting place with a simplicity which
eclipsed the pomp of all royal funerals, and to the
sound of a low song of tired but indefatigable sadness
stronger and more formidable than the pæans which
celebrate the triumphs and the pageants of kings.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. By a strange irony of fate, this tune, which the revolutionaries
have made their own, was originally an official tune, composed
probably by some obscure military bandmaster, and played at
the funerals of officers and high officials.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The impression left on my mind by this funeral is
deep. As I saw these hundred thousand men march
past so quietly, so simply, in their bourgeois clothes,
singing in careless, almost conversational fashion, I
seemed nevertheless to hear the “tramping of innumerable
armies,” and to feel the breath of the</p>

<p class='c011'>Last night, after Bauman’s funeral, which passed off

and doctors were shot in front of the university, as they
were on their way home, by Cossacks, who were stationed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>in the Riding School, opposite the university. The
Cossacks fired without orders. They were incensed, as
many of the troops were, by the display of red flags, and
they disliked processions.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The last three days have been days of curious disorder
and anarchy. I will try and note briefly what has been
taking place.</p>

<p class='c011'>The day after Bauman’s funeral (November 3rd) was
the anniversary of the Emperor’s accession, and all the
“hooligans” of the city, who are now called the “Black
Gang,” used the opportunity to make counter demonstrations
under the ægis of the National flag. The
students did nothing, they were in no way aggressive;
but the hooligans when they came across a student beat
him and in many cases killed him. The police did
nothing; they seemed to have disappeared. These
hooligans paraded the town in small groups, sometimes
uniting, blocking the traffic, demanding money from
well-dressed people, killing students, and making themselves
generally objectionable. When the police were
appealed to they shrugged their shoulders and said:
“Liberty.” The hooligans demanded the release of the
man who had killed Bauman. “They have set free so
many of their men,” they said, referring to the revolutionaries,
“we want our man set free.” Practically the
town was in a state of anarchy; anybody could kill
any one else with impunity. In one of the biggest
streets a hooligan came up to a man and asked him for
money; he gave him ten kopecks. “Is that all?” said
the hooligan, “Take that,” and he killed him with a
Finnish knife. I was myself stopped by a band on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>Twerskaia and asked politely to contribute to their fund,
the fund of the “Black Gang,” which I did with considerable
alacrity. However, students, or those whom
they considered to be students in disguise, were the
people they mostly attacked. The citizens of the
town in general soon began to think that this state
of things was intolerable, and vigorous representations
were made to the town Duma that some steps should
be taken to put an end to it. The hooligans broke the
windows of the Hôtel Métropole and those of several
shops. There was a general impression among them
that liberty meant doing as much damage as they
pleased. This state of things lasted three days, and
now it has been stopped—utterly and completely
stopped. A notice is published forbidding all demonstrations
in the streets with flags. The police have
reappeared, and everything has resumed its normal
course. These bands of hooligans were small and
exceedingly easy to deal with. The disorders were
completely unnecessary. But they have done some
good in one way; they have brought home to everybody
the necessity for order and the maintenance of
order, and the conviction that if the police are removed
the result will be anarchy. However, considering the
state of lawlessness that existed, it is remarkable how
little damage was done.</p>

<p class='c011'>The night before last, as I was walking back to the
hotel after dinner, I met two omnibuses full of wounded
students being driven to the hospital. One student was
torn to pieces by a hooligan crowd yesterday afternoon;
and a friend of mine from the windows of the Hôtel
National saw another trampled to death.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>The general tenour of opinion among the Liberals
is that the Government must prove their good intentions
by deeds and not by words, and that soothing Manifestoes
are of no use now. There are three points on
which they insist. First, they demand that the partial
amnesty should be made complete; that there should
be an amnesty for all political offenders without
exception. Secondly, they say that they have no
guarantee for the new reforms, because the Ministers are
taken from the Bureaucracy. They demand new
Ministers taken from the Zemstva. Thirdly, they
demand the resignation of General Trepoff. With
regard to the first point it would be a wise step on
the part of the Government to satisfy the Liberals.
The concessions will probably be made gradually, and
I suppose their maxim is not to give too much at once
or the demands will increase. It is a pity, if the
Government have decided to give in on this point,
that they did not do so at once. Every concession
seems, as it is, to have been extorted by force. That
is the general impression of the Liberals: “We have
been given nothing; everything we have obtained
we have extorted by force.” With regard to the
resignation of General Trepoff, if I were a Russian
and guarantees were given that the police were no
longer going to interfere with individuals, and that
the secret police force was to be abolished—and I
believe this is being done—I should make a demonstration
for the retention of General Trepoff. If there
are to be police at all to keep order, somebody must
manage them. The Russian police are a hopelessly
incompetent body, and General Trepoff is a thoroughly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>competent man. He may have used too heavy a hand
sometimes, and I can understand the people being
indignant that he should rule Russia like a dictator.
On the other hand he knows how to keep order;
he knows how to manage the police, and if the liberty
of individuals is respected—and, so far, since the
publication of the Manifesto it has been—I cannot see
why any one should desire his retirement. However,
the discussion of this point is futile. General Trepoff
has become a symbol, like General Galliffet in France
after the Commune. To the ordinary Russian Liberal
he represents the Bureaucracy and all the evils of the
old régime, and nothing can change that impression.
His position is probably untenable, and he will be
forced to resign, though, as far as liberty is concerned,
at present the people do exactly what they like in the
way of political meetings, the newspapers write what
they please, and the prisons at Moscow and St. Petersburg
have been partially emptied of their political
prisoners. The Russians have, in fact, got the two
boons which Matthew Arnold said were so dearly
cherished by the English middle class—liberty to make
fools of themselves, and publicity to show the world how
they are doing it. The extreme revolutionary party
wish to do away with the Emperor altogether and
to have a Republic. If this is done some people say
there will be a civil war in every town and village
in the Russian Empire. As it is, half the people do not
understand what a Constitution means. A soldier, for
instance, asked whether it meant that the Emperor had
resigned; and some of the educated class understand
it still less.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>Altogether the Liberals seem to me to be in too great
a hurry; nevertheless things are apparently calming
down. The question is—Will Count Witte between
now and then succeed in thoroughly gaining the
confidence of the Liberals and of the representatives of
the Zemtsva? If he succeeds all will be well. The
extreme Conservative Party, represented by the
<em>Moskovski Viedomosti</em>, is really of no practical account.
Its point of view was admirably represented by the
hall porter of one of the old and conservative families
at Moscow, who on the day of the publication of the
Manifesto said: “The Emperor has deserted us.”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>I arrived here this morning from Moscow. The
chief piece of news which is being discussed is
the dismissal of Trepoff. Of Trepoff one always
hears contradictory accounts: some people saying he
is an inveterate reactionary, a Jew-baiter, &#38;c.; others
that he is a man of great common sense, liberal in
policy as far as this is compatible with common
sense, and never afraid of speaking his mind. I
heard from people who ought to know that he was
strongly in favour of the granting of the Manifesto
of October 17th. What aroused the general hatred
against him was his “order for the day” telling
the soldiers not to spare cartridges, should there be
disorders. I met him once here before the war broke
out. I thought he seemed a sensible, strong-willed
person. When he was Chief of the Police at Moscow
he had the reputation of being sensible, of keeping
order well, of being rather heavy-handed, and of
committing foolish <i><span lang="fr">gaffes</span></i> from time to time. I am
certain he is neither the monster he is made out by
the Liberal press here and abroad, nor yet the Cromwellian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>genius other people would have us believe
him to be. I expect that his strength lies in the
fact that he does not mind saying what he thinks.
In St. Petersburg this quality is so rare that people
who possess it appear to be geniuses.</p>

expression of the “Liberation movement” in

<p class='c011'>The number of hooligans who now infest the streets
is great. A story is circulating of a hooligan who
stopped a man and demanded his watch. He gave
it. The hooligan then asked for his coat. He gave
it also, the hooligan giving him his own coat in exchange.
When the man who had been robbed got
home he found his own watch and 170 roubles in the
pocket of the hooligan’s coat.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The official declaration of the postponement of the
Polish constitutional liberties is causing a good deal
of talk and excitement.</p>

<p class='c011'>One point with regard to Poland which people
sometimes overlook is that there are Poles in Germany;
Poles in the North of Germany besides those
in German Poland; and moreover a great many Poles.
German Poland also is an important factor in itself.
The situation therefore is analogous to what would
happen if Ireland were a country shared between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>France and England, and if England had been
at war with Germany or any Power, just as Russia
has been at war with Japan, and if while that war
lasted France had promised to cause no trouble on
our Irish frontier. Whether the German Emperor
made any definite promise not to interfere on the
Polish frontier during the Japanese War it is impossible
to say; what at all events is certain is that
an independent Poland would not be viewed favourably
in Germany, because it would tend to produce
an independent German Poland and a discontented
and rebellious Polish population in North Germany.
One has only to read Bismarck’s Memoirs to see
that one of the keynotes of his policy was a friendship
with Russia based on common interests and
action with regard to Poland. It is unlikely that
the German Emperor has departed from this traditional
policy. However that may be, at this moment
the situation in Poland, the prolonged strike which
has continued steadily long after the strikes have
ceased in other parts of Russia, calls for some immediate
action. Two courses were open to the
Government: either to grant autonomy at once or
to enforce order by martial law. There is a rumour
current here that the German Emperor, who would,
as has already been explained, be strongly opposed
to anything like Polish autonomy, had come to
an agreement with the Russian Emperor on this
point. The Russian newspapers to-day say that
German troops are being moved to the frontier. In
any case we are face to face with the fact that martial
law has been proclaimed in Poland; and any sentimental
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>sympathy with the Poles which one might
feel is counteracted by the fact that had they only
waited until the Duma or the Constituent Assembly
met in Russia they would probably have got autonomy
without any trouble. Whether the enforcement of
martial law in Poland is a wise measure or not is
another question; but it is one of two necessary
courses.</p>

<p class='c011'>The fact is that the Poles, like the Liberals here,
are in a great hurry. They wish everything to be
done at once, and changes which have taken some
centuries to elaborate in other and calmer countries
to be brought about here in a few days. The Liberals
are now crying loudly that nothing will satisfy them
but a Constituent Assembly based on universal suffrage.
They are unwilling to wait a few months until order
can be restored, and until the Duma can meet and
vote on the adoption or the non-adoption of such
an assembly. They wish it to come straight into
existence, like Pallas from the brain of Zeus. All
that is written in the Liberal papers here must not
be taken as an absolutely impartial and dispassionate
record of facts. A well-informed, sensible, and Liberal
Russian told me yesterday that some of these papers—and
among them not the most Radical, some of which,
he said, were managed by sincere and able men—were
merely for opposition for the sake of opposition, and
that whatever Count Witte said or did they would
say it was wrong; some of them act the part of
deliberate inciters and wish merely to add fuel to
the general excitement. I am not of course alluding
to Liberal newspapers which have an old-established
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>and solid reputation such as the <cite>Russkie Viedomosti</cite>
of Moscow. There is a newspaper here which was
especially violent in insisting on the fact that not
only General Trepoff but also all the military should
be removed from the town; these violent articles did
not prevent them from sending privately to General
Trepoff to ask for a squadron of Cossacks to protect
their office, begging at the same time that this request
might be kept secret.</p>

<p class='c011'>The “Intellectuals” of Russia have many qualities,
but everything they say must not be taken as being
irrefutable; they are human, like the rest of us. They
are less practical than some of us, even if we do not
agree with a well-known French manager of a <i><span lang="fr">café</span></i>
here, who said: “<span lang="fr">Les Intelligents!</span>” (with a snort
of disgust). “Ce sont les intelligents les plus bêtes
que j’aie jamais vus.” What one is hearing constantly
said by sensible people is that before any political
theory or system is carried into effect order must
be restored; that the reforms which have been granted
cannot be carried out in detail in a day; that there
is one man capable of carrying these reforms out,
and that he is Count Witte; that to oppose Count
Witte for the sake of opposition is merely criminal,
because if Count Witte throws up the sponge the
game will be lost and the result will be universal
anarchy, the only remedy for which will be universal
and drastic repression. The trouble is that Count
Witte is a man of business, and no one else in Russia
is. It seems to me that the Liberals by their action
are in danger of creating a party of reaction. For the
so-called “reactionary party” did not up to the present
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>moment exist. That is to say, there was practically
nobody of any importance who wished to revert to
the state of things before the granting of the Constitution.
On the other hand, there are a great many
people who think that the maintenance of order is
all important.</p>

<p class='c011'>The opponents of the Government, however, say
that it is making for disorder, and point to the
massacres of the Jews in the provinces. The Kronstadt
mutiny is said not to have been political; nevertheless
if the sailors had not got drunk, nothing could
have prevented their blowing Peterhof to bits. A
universal strike is threatened immediately.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>When one is in England it is very difficult to
form an idea of what is taking place in Russia,
and this is not owing to the absence but to the
superabundance of news concerning Russian events.
One cannot see the wood for the trees. In Russia
there is also a superabundance of news and of rumours;
but merely by walking about in the streets one is
brought face to face with certain facts, enabling one
to check the news to some extent. I have been in
Russia a week, at St. Petersburg, and I arrived here
yesterday. In St. Petersburg the impression that
a stranger receives on arriving is that everything is
going on exactly the same as usual. The streets
are crowded, the shops are all open, and there is
nothing to show that the country is in a state of

<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>one receives is that the revolutionary party is admirably
organised, and although there are dissensions among it—as,
for instance, between the Social Revolutionaries
and the Social Democrats—they are willing if not
ready to coalesce at any given moment against the
Government, whereas the body of people who do
not side with the revolutionaries are split up into
various groups, differing on some of the most important
points of policy. Perhaps the most important
of these groups is the Constitutional Democratic
Party, which is in favour of universal suffrage and a
National Assembly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Especially remarkable are the various shapes taken
by the criticism directed against Count Witte by the
various parties. Roughly speaking, this criticism may
be divided into three heads:</p>

<p class='c011'>1. The revolutionaries (including the Constitutional
Democrats) say that Count Witte is a Bureaucrat; that
nothing good can come of him, and that he and his
<i><span lang="fr">régime</span></i> must go.</p>

<p class='c011'>2. The Moderates—I call them Moderates for want
of a better word—say that Count Witte has not proved
himself to be equal to his task; that since the publication
of the Manifesto he has not formulated a single
law save an ineffectual one with regard to the Press.</p>

<p class='c011'>3. The reactionary Nationalists say that Count
Witte is a traitor, that he has been bought by the
Jews and is playing for a Republic. There is a
sentence of Napoleon’s which perhaps may occur
to Count Witte under the present circumstances: “Un
homme d’état est-il fait pour être sensible? N’est-ce
pas un personnage complètement excentrique, toujours
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>seul d’un côté, avec le monde de l’autre?” Count
Witte is at this moment completely “excentric.” If
he succeeds—and by succeeding I mean remaining
in power until the Duma meets—his triumph will be
great. To give some idea of the atmosphere which
we vaguely call public opinion, I will quote some
of the <i><span lang="la">obiter dicta</span></i> I have heard since I have been here.
That Count Witte is a cunning old fox, worse than
Plehve. That Count Witte is not what he was; that
he is merely incapable of executing what he undertook.
That Count Witte is the most far-seeing man in
Russia; that he centralised Russia in order to lead
to a revolution, and thus make radical changes easier;
that he placed the railways in the hands of the State
and created the spirit monopoly in order to have no
private interests to deal with when the crash should
come. That Count Witte is a Radical of the type of
Robespierre, and will only declare himself to be on
the side of popular representation when the upper
classes are entirely destroyed.</p>

<p class='c011'>That the Government is too weak, and that it all
comes from having been too weak from the first and
from not having hanged the Kronstadt mutineers.
That the Government was too reactionary from the
first, and that it destroyed the confidence of the people
by establishing martial law in Poland directly after the
Manifesto. That the <i><span lang="fr">régime</span></i> of Plehve was better than
the present state of anarchy. That the present <i><span lang="fr">régime</span></i>
is more reactionary than the system of Plehve. That
with a Government as revolutionary as the existing one
nothing good can be expected; that the Constitution
should be withdrawn, the Emperor should be deposed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>and another appointed, and that Count Witte should
be hanged. That the Government has not been explicit
enough; that a programme including two Legislative
Chambers—an Upper and Lower Chamber—should
be published and sworn to by the Emperor,
and that the utmost severity should be employed, after
that, in case of necessity. That no Government at all
is necessary in Russia; only a <em>Bund</em>, a Council of Empire,
which should meet once a year and manage the
railways; that the Army should be disbanded and the
country entirely decentralised. That a Dictator should
be appointed at once, and 10,000 “intellectuals” arrested.</p>

<p class='c011'>That the revolutionaries merely want to destroy any
form of government as an act of revenge; that they are
as the Irish, “agin the Government”; that this act of
revenge is not surprising, considering they are smarting
under the monstrous wrong which has been done them
for years, <em>i.e.</em>, misgovernment carried to the extreme.
That nothing can possibly restore peace to Russia
except universal suffrage, and that Russia being by
nature more democratic than other European countries
need not feel herself bound to follow their example, but
must proceed straight to universal suffrage. That the
Emperor should go to Moscow. That if the Emperor
goes to Moscow it would excite the peasants to kill the
middle and upper classes. That this would be a bad
thing. That this would be a good thing. That if the
Emperor goes to Moscow he will be killed. That it is
nonsense to think the Emperor would be killed at
Moscow; that his position cannot be worse than it is,
but might be improved by such a step. That the
Kremlin would be a safer residence than the Tsarskoe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>Selo. That the Emperor must take an oath to the
Constitution, and give guarantees that it will not be
withdrawn. That the Emperor should put himself at
the head of the peasants and the Army and snap his
fingers at the Socialists and the landlords and give the
peasants the land.</p>

<p class='c011'>All these opinions I have heard from Russians since
I have been here. In St. Petersburg considerable
anxiety was felt as to what would happen in Moscow
on the occasion of the Emperor’s birthday (to-day),
since the reactionary party—the “Alliance of Russian
People”—had requested and been allowed to organise a
demonstration opposite the Kremlin. These fears, however,
proved groundless. I was present at the demonstration.
The holy banners were carried in procession
from the Kremlin to the public place outside the
Kremlin walls, where a service was held. The procession
then returned into the Kremlin at twelve
o’clock. There was a small crowd looking on, and
one man (a butcher) made a speech, saying that the
Emperor had been terrorised into giving a Constitution,
but that he would be requested to take it back again.
The crowd cheered, and one policeman repeated five
times that the speaker was a fine fellow. The crowd
then marched in procession to the Governor-General’s
house, and Admiral Dubassoff spoke to the crowd.
This crowd was a ridiculously small one; it dispersed
at noon. The population of Moscow was conspicuous
by its absence.</p>

<p class='c011'>A great deal is talked at present about the doings of
the hooligans in St. Petersburg and Moscow. In St.
Petersburg the number of beggars in the street is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>remarkable; here the doings of the hooligans are said
to take place mostly at night. One hears on all sides
that the state of things is impossible and that the
streets are unsafe, yet they are crowded with people all
day long. There appears also to be some danger from
the reckless way in which the population toy with
“Browning” pistols in self-defence, but except for this
and the hooligans there is no kind of danger for
foreigners here.</p>

<p class='c011'>The state of the Army here has caused the Government
a good deal of alarm. The mutiny in the Rostov
Regiment came to an abrupt end yesterday, and to-day
news has arrived of a manifesto granting the soldiers
extra pay, extra meat, and soap. The discontent among
the soldiers and sailors has been up to now in every
case economical and not political, therefore it is thought
that if the economical demands are satisfied the discontent
will disappear. It will be well for the Government
if it does, for in the long run the ultimate issue
of the conflict must depend on the Army, and the
symptoms which have declared themselves up to now
are not reassuring. It is quite possible, however, that
the soap and the blankets which are to be given to the
men may allay their political restlessness. The Cavalry
is said to have been all along thoroughly reliable.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Wednesday, the 20th of December, punctually at
midday the strike began in Moscow. The lift ceased
working in the hotel, the electric light was turned off
and I laid in a large store of books and cigarettes
against coming events. The strike was said to be an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>answer to the summary proceedings of the Government
and its action in arresting leaders of the revolutionary
committee, &#38;c., and its watchword was to be: “A
Constituent Assembly based upon universal suffrage.”
Beyond the electric light going out nothing happened
on this day. On Thursday, the 21st, most of the shops
began to shut. The man who cleaned the boots in the
hotel made the following remark: “I now understand
that the people enjoy great power.” I heard a shot fired
somewhere from the hotel at nine o’clock in the evening.
I asked the hall porter whether the theatres were open.
He said they were shut, and added: “And who would
dream of going to the theatre in these times of stress?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The next day I drove with a friend into the country
to a village called Chernaia, about 25 versts from Moscow
on the Novgorod road, which before the days of railways
was famous for its highway robberies and assaults
on the rich merchants by the hooligans of that day.
We drove in a big wooden sledge drawn by two horses,
the coachman standing up all the while. We went to
visit two old maids, who were peasants and lived in the
village. One of them had got stranded in Moscow, and
owing to the railway strike was unable to go back again
and so we took her with us, otherwise she would have
walked home. We started at 10.30 and arrived at 1.30.
The road was absolutely still—a thick carpet of snow, upon
which fresh flakes drifting in the fitful gusts of wind fell
gently. Looking at the drifting flakes which seemed to
be tossed about in the air, the first old maid said that a
man’s life was like a snowflake in the wind, and that she
had never thought she would go home with us on her
sister’s name-day.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>When we arrived at the village we found a meal
ready for us, which, although the fast of Advent was
being strictly observed and the food made with fasting-butter,
was far from jejune. It consisted of pies with
rice and cabbage inside, and cold fish and tea and jam,
and some vodka for me—the guest. The cottage consisted
of one room and two very small ante-rooms—the
walls, floors, and ceilings of plain deal. Five or six rich
ikons hung in the corner of the room, and a coloured
oleograph of Father John of Kronstadt on one of the
walls. A large stove heated the room. Soon some
guests arrived to congratulate old maid No. 2 on her
name-day, and after a time the pope entered, blessed
the room, and sat down to tea. We talked of the strike
and how quiet the country was and of the hooligans in
the town. “No,” said the pope with gravity, “we have
our own hooligans.” A little later the village schoolmaster
arrived, who looked about twenty years old, and
was a little tiny man with a fresh face and gold-rimmed
spectacles, with his wife, who, like the æsthetic lady in
Gilbert and Sullivan’s “Patience,” was “massive.” I
asked the pope if I could live unmolested in this village.
He said, “Yes, but if you want to work you won’t be
quiet in this house, because your two hostesses chatter
and drink tea all day and all night.” At three o’clock
we thought we had better be starting home; it was
getting dark, the snow was falling heavily. The old
maids said we couldn’t possibly go. We should (1) lose
our way, (2) be robbed by tramps, (3) be massacred by
strikers on the railway line, (4) not be allowed to enter
the town, (5) be attacked by hooligans when we reached
the dark streets. We sent for Vassili, the coachman, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>consult with him. “Can you find your way home?” we
asked. “Yes, I can,” he said. “Shall we lose our
way?” “We might lose our way—it happens,” he said
slowly, “it happens times and again; but we might not—it
often doesn’t happen.” “Might we be attacked on
the way?” “We might—it happens—they attack; but
we might not—sometimes they don’t attack.” “Are the
horses tired?” “Yes, the horses are tired.” “Then we
had better not go.” “The horses can go all right,” he
said. Then we thought we would stay; but Vassili
said that his master would curse him if he stayed unless
we “added” something.</p>

<p class='c011'>So we settled to stay, and the schoolmaster took us
to see the village school, which was clean, roomy, and
altogether an excellent home of learning. Then he
took us to a neighbouring factory which had not
struck, and in which he presided over a night class
for working men and women. From here we telephoned
to Moscow and learned that everything was quiet in the
city. I talked to one of the men in the factory about
the strike. “It’s all very well for the young men,” one
said, “they are hot-headed and like striking; but we—we
have to starve for a month. That’s what it means.”
Then we went to the school neighbouring the factory
where the night class was held. There were two
rooms, one for men presided over by the schoolmaster
and one for women presided over by his wife. They
had a lesson of two hours in reading, writing, and
arithmetic. The men came to be taught in separate
batches; one batch coming one week, one another.
This day there were five men and two boys and six
women. The men were reading a story about a bear—rather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>a tedious tale. “Yes, we are reading,” one of
them said to me, “and we understand some of it.”
That was, at any rate, consoling. They read to
themselves first, then aloud in turn, standing up, and
then they were asked to tell what they had read in
their own words. They read haltingly, with difficulty
grasping familiar words. They related fluently, except
one man, who said he could remember nothing whatsoever
about the doings of the bear. One little boy was
doing with lightning rapidity those kind of sums which,
by giving you too many data and not enough—a superabundance
of detail, leaving out the all that appears
so imperatively necessary—seem to some minds
peculiarly insoluble. The sum in question stated that
a factory consisted of 770 hands—men, women, and
children, and that the men received half as much again
as the women, &#38;c. That particular proportion of wages
seems to exist in the arithmetic books of all countries
to the despair of the non-mathematical, and the little
boy insisted on my following every step of his process
of reckoning; but not even he with the wisdom and
sympathy of babes succeeded in teaching me how to
do that kind of sum. He afterwards wrote in a
copybook pages of declensions of Russian nouns and
adjectives. Here I found I could help him and I saved
him some trouble by dictating them to him; though
every now and then we had some slight doubt and
discussion about the genitive plural. In the woman’s
class, one girl explained to us, with tears in her eyes,
how difficult it was for her to attend this class. Her
fellow-workers laughed at her for it, and at home they
told her that a woman’s place was to be at work and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>not to meddle with books. Those who attend this
school show that they are really anxious to learn, as the
effort and self-sacrifice needed are great.</p>

<p class='c011'>We stayed till the end of the lesson and then we
went home, where an excellent supper of eggs, &#38;c., was
awaiting us. We found the two old maids and their
first cousin, who told us she was about to go to law for
a legacy of 100,000 roubles which had been left her, but
which was disputed by a more distant relation on the
mother’s side. We talked of law suits and politics and
miracles, and real and false faith-healers, till bedtime
came. A bed was made for me alongside of the stove.
Made is the right word, for it was literally built up
before my eyes. A sleeping place was also made for
the coachman on the floor of the small ante-room; then
the rest of the company disappeared to sleep. I say
disappeared, because I literally do not know where
in this small interior there was room for them to sleep.
They consisted of the two old maids, their niece and
her little girl, aged three, and another little girl, aged
seven. My travelling companion slept in the room, but
the rest disappeared, I suppose on the top of the stove,
only it seemed to reach the ceiling; somewhere they
were, for the little girl, excited by the events of the day,
sang snatches of song till a late hour in the night. The
next morning, after I got up, the room was transformed
from a bedroom into a dining-room and aired, breakfast
was served, and at ten we started back again in
the snow to Moscow.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the 23rd we arrived in the town at one o’clock.
The streets of the suburbs seemed to be unusually still.
My companion said to me: “How quiet the streets are,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>but it seems to me an uncanny, evil quietness.” My
companion lived in the Lobkovski Pereoolok, and I had
the day before sent my things from the hotel to an
apartment in the adjoining street, the Mwilnikov.
When we arrived at the entrance of these streets we
found them blocked by a crowd and guarded by police
and dragoons. We got through the other end of the
streets, and we were told that the night before Fielder’s
School, which is a large building at the corner of these
two streets, had been the scene of a revolutionary
meeting; that the revolutionaries had been surrounded
in this house, had refused to surrender, had thrown a
bomb at an officer and killed him, had been fired at
by artillery, and had finally surrendered after killing
one officer and five men, with 17 casualties—15
wounded and two killed. All this had happened
in my very street during my absence. An hour later
we again heard a noise of guns, and the armed rising
(of which some of the leaders, who were to have seized
the Governor-General of the town and set up a
provisional Government, had been arrested the night
before in my street) had nevertheless broken out in
all parts of the town. A little later I saw a crowd
of people on foot and in sledges flying in panic down
the street shouting “Kazaki!” I heard and saw
nothing else of any interest during the day. There
were crowds of people in the streets till nightfall.</p>

<p class='c011'>On Sunday, Christmas Eve, I drove to the hotel in
the centre of Moscow to see a friend. The aspect of
the town was extraordinary. The streets were full of
people—<i><span lang="fr">flâneurs</span></i> who were either walking about or
gathered together in small and large groups at the street
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>corners. Distant, and sometimes quite near, sounds of
firing were audible, and nobody seemed to care a scrap;
they were everywhere talking, discussing, and laughing.
Imagine the difference between this and the scenes
described in Paris during the street fighting in ’32,
’48, and ’71.</p>

<p class='c011'>People went about their business just as usual. If
there was a barricade they drove round it. The cabmen
never dreamt of not going anywhere, although one said
to me that it was very frightening. Moreover, an
insuperable curiosity seemed to lead them to go and
look where things were happening. Several were killed
in this way. On the other hand, at the slightest
approach of troops they ran in panic like hares,
although the troops do not do the passers-by any
mischief. Two or three times I have been walking
in the streets when dragoons galloped past, and come
to no harm. We heard shots all the time, and met
the same groups of people and passed two barricades.
The barricades are mostly not like those of the
Faubourg St. Antoine, but small impediments made
of branches and an overturned sledge; they are put
there to annoy and wear out the troops and not to
stand siege. The method of warfare that the revolutionaries
have adopted is a guerilla warfare of the
streets. They fire or throw bombs and rapidly disperse;
they have made some attempts to seize the
Nikolaiev Railway Station, but have in all cases been
repulsed. The attitude of the man in the street is
curious: sometimes he is indignant with the strikers,
sometimes indignant with the Government. If you ask
a person of revolutionary sympathies he will tell you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>that sympathy is entirely with the revolution; if you
ask a person of moderate principles he will tell you
that the “people” are indignant with the strikers; but
the attitude of the average man in the street seems to
me one of sceptical indifference in spite of all, in spite
of trade ceasing, houses being fired at, and the hospitals
being full to overflowing of dead and wounded. The
fact is that disorders have lost their first power of
creating an impression; they have become everyday
occurrences.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here are various remarks I heard. One man, a
commissionaire, asked whether I thought it was right to
fire on the revolutionaries. I hesitated, gathering my
thoughts to explain that I thought that they thoroughly
deserved it since they began it, but that the Government
nevertheless had brought it about by their dilatoriness.
(This is exactly what I think.) Misunderstanding my
hesitation, he said: “Surely you, a <em>foreigner</em>, need not
mind saying what you think, and you know it is wrong.”
(This was curious, because these people, commissionaires,
porters, &#38;c., are often reactionary.) A cabman
said to me: “Who do you think will get the best of it?”
I said, “I don’t know, what do you think?” “Nothing
will come of it,” he said. “There will still be rich
people like you and poor people like me, and whether
the Government is in the hands of the <em>chinovniks</em> or the
students is all one and the same.” Another man, a
porter, an ex-soldier, said it was awful. You couldn’t
go anywhere or drive anywhere without risking being
killed. Soldiers came back from the war and were
killed in the streets. A bullet came, and then the man
was done for. Another man, a kind of railway
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>employee, said that the Russians had no stamina, that
the Poles would never give in, but the Russians would
directly. Another man, fond of paradox, said to me
that he hoped all the fanatics would be shot, and that
then the Government would be upset. A policeman was
guarding the street which led to the hotel. I asked if I
could pass. “How could I not let a Barine with whom I
am acquainted pass?” he said. Then a baker’s boy
came up with a tray of rolls on his head, also asking to
pass—to go to the hotel. After some discussion the
policeman let him go, but suddenly said, “Or are you a
rascal?” Then I asked him what he thought of it all.
He said: “We fire as little as possible. They are fools.”
The fact is that among the wealthier and educated
classes the feeling is either one of intense sympathy or
violent indignation with the revolutionaries; among the
lower classes it is a feeling of sceptical resignation or
indifference. “Things are bad—nothing will come of it
for us.”</p>

      <div class='line'><em>Christmas Day.</em></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>At midnight the windows of our house had been
rattled by the firing of guns somewhere near; but on
Christmas morning (this is not the Russian Christmas)
one was able to get about. I drove down one of the
principal streets, the Kouznetski Most, into another large
street, the Neglinii Proiesd (as if it were down Bond
Street into Piccadilly), when suddenly in a flash all the
cabs began to drive fast up the street. My cab went on.
He was inquisitive. We saw nothing. He shouted to
another cab, asking him what was the matter. No
answer. We went a little further down, when along the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>Neglinii Proiesd we saw a patrol and guns advancing.
“Go back,” shouted one of the soldiers, waving his
rifle—and away we went. Later, I believe there was
firing there. Further along we met more patrols
and ambulances. The shops are not only shut but
boarded up.</p>

<p class='c011'>Next day I walked to the Nikolaiev Station in the
afternoon. It is from here that the trains go to St.
Petersburg; the trains are running now, but how the
passengers start I don’t know, for it was impossible to
get near the station. Cabs were galloping away from
it, and the square in front of it had been cleared by
Cossacks. I think it was attacked this afternoon. I
walked into the Riansh Station, which was next door.
It was a scene of desolation: empty trains, stacked-up
luggage, third-class passengers encamped in the waiting-room.
There was a perpetual noise of firing. Practically
the town is under martial law. Nobody is allowed
to be out of doors after nine o’clock under penalty of
three months’ imprisonment or 3,000 roubles fine.
Householders have been made responsible for people
firing out of their windows. The idea of collective
responsibility is a shock to some Russians. During the
last twenty years the system has led, through the perpetual
shifting of responsibility, to the annihilation of
responsibility; and this in its turn has produced a
revolution of irresponsibility. Some people talk as if
the revolution were an evil element which had sprung
from hell without any cause, a sudden visitation like the
plague, as if it were not the absolutely logical and inevitable
result of the particular form of bad government
which has obtained in Russia during the last twenty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>years. These people pass a sponge over this fact. They
say to people of liberal ideas: “You have brought this
about,” then, asked if they are in favour of the Constitution,
assent; which should prove them to be opportunists.
They do not like being called opportunists.</p>

<p class='c011'>This morning, December 27th, there is considerable
movement and traffic in the streets; the small shops
are open, and the tobacconists. News has come from
St. Petersburg of the Electorate Law. The question
is now whether it will satisfy the people. Firing is
still going on; they say a factory is being attacked.
The troops who were supposed to be disaffected have
proved absolutely loyal. The one way to make them
loyal was to throw bombs at them. The policemen are
now armed with rifles and bayonets. I asked an
educated man this afternoon if he thought the Electorate
Law would satisfy people. He said he thought
not. He said that the people demanded a far wider
suffrage law. “Are you in favour yourself of universal
suffrage?” I asked. “No,” he answered; “but when I
see that the whole people demand it, I submit to the
majority. The Government has as yet <em>given</em> nothing;
everything has been torn from it, and more will
have to be torn from it.” One learns here at any
rate not to generalise and not to prophesy. A
cabman said this afternoon: “There is an illness abroad,
we are sick, it will pass—but God remains.” I agree
with him.</p>

<p class='c011'>I do not believe that it is a case of bricks falling out
of a wall until the wall falls down, but of a young tree
shedding bark. The illness, however, is a severe one,
and it is idle to blame the patient for the violence of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>symptoms and the doctor for the inadequacy of his
remedies. The people to blame are those who
made the patient ill by feeding him on poison.
And some of these have already met with their just
reward.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>If it is difficult—and it seems to be difficult to the
verge of impossibility—for the historian of the
present day to write impartially about political movements
which happened in the days of Queen Elizabeth
and of Mary Queen of Scots, how infinitely more difficult
must it be to arrive at an impartial view of events
when one is oneself in the centre of them and living
among the actors who are contributing to what is afterwards
called history! The historian solves the question
by frankly affiliating himself to one side (like Froude or
Macaulay or Taine), and he is probably right in doing
this; I notice, also, that our most eminent correspondents
do the same. Therefore I confess at once that
I am in no way free from prejudices, and I make
no pretence of invincible impartiality; only I have seen
and heard enough of both sides to learn one thing—that
the two parties who are now engaged in strife in
Russia are both right or both wrong. I will try to the
best of my ability to stifle my own feelings, and, like a
piece of blotting-paper which absorbs red or black ink
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>indiscriminately, try to reproduce as best I can fragments
of what I absorb.</p>

<p class='c011'>The strike is over, although I believe some revolutionaries
are still holding out in a factory near the
Zoological Gardens. The shops are open, the electric
light is shining on the hard, snowy, ice-cold streets, and
life is going on, in the Russian expression, in its old
rut. I suppose the first question which will present
itself to people abroad anxious for information is:
What did it all amount to? The second question:
What is the result of it? The third is possibly: What
do the people in Moscow, the inhabitant, the man in
the street, think of it? Practically, it did not amount
to very much; a general strike was proclaimed which
was to take place all over Russia with the object of
obtaining universal suffrage. The strike was not universal.
It was closely followed by an armed rising of
the revolutionary party in Moscow with the object of
arresting the Governor-General and establishing a
temporary Government. It resulted in complete and
utter failure; and this seems to point to one of two
things: either that the revolutionary party is less well
organised than we supposed it to be, or that it wrongly
gauged popular feeling and no longer found such strong
support in public opinion as it did before. If it be
judged by its recent action it cannot be said to have
given proof of any good organisation, since it was
obviously a mistake to foment a movement among the
military—using economic needs and demands as a
weapon—a week before the strike began. The
economic demands were made by the soldiers, and
satisfied immediately, and their mutiny ceased. It is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>nonsense to pretend that the soldiers have any revolutionary
tendencies, and the revolutionaries made a great
mistake in trying to undermine their belief in the
Emperor. The same thing holds good as regards the
peasants; and only yesterday a person with ultra-Radical
convictions said to me: “The peasant, if he
is hungry, can easily be made to loot and burn; but if
he is replete he will send anybody who talks politics to
him to the devil, and if any one attacks the Emperor
before him he will tear him to pieces; possibly in
twenty or thirty years things will be different and he
will be an enlightened man; at present he is not, and
there is no use in not facing the fact. The revolutionaries
have made a cardinal error in attacking the
peasants’ and the soldiers’ only ideal—call it ideal, idol,
or what you like.” Therefore I say that in this case the
behaviour of the revolutionaries showed neither insight
nor statesmanship nor good organisation. It is possible,
of course, that the strike may have been brought about,
as I wrote before, by the workmen forcing the leaders’
hands, being unwilling to starve for a month but ready
to rise in arms and fight for several days.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now, as to what actually happened. With regard
to the loss of life most people seem to be agreed
in thinking that neither the revolutionaries nor the
soldiers suffered very great losses, but that nine-tenths
of the people killed were the onlookers among the
public. Sometimes, of course, it was their own fault;
sometimes it was not. When firing was going on
it was as a rule difficult to get anywhere near it
because the police warned you “off the course.” But
then one must take into account that the streets in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>which the firing happened were inhabited, and that
sometimes the unfortunate inhabitants were shot
through no fault of their own. I think it is quite
evident that there was a great deal of entirely unnecessary
and absolutely futile bombarding of private
houses. No doubt the revolutionaries fired from such
houses; but they fired and went away, and then the
house was battered and the revolutionaries were not
caught. It must not be thought that Moscow is a heap
of cinders as in 1812. For the most part the actual
traces of bombardment are slight. The damage done
to Fielder’s School, for instance, which is in my street,
amounts to this: that the windows are broken and
there is one hole in the wall. On the other hand,
several houses have been entirely destroyed, and the
printing offices of the <cite>Russkoe Slovo</cite> and some factories
burnt—it is difficult to ascertain by which side, but
possibly by both. This afternoon I went to a hospital
to see some wounded soldiers, and in one of the wards
the windows had been shattered by a bullet which had
lodged in the cornice. Nothing will prevent me from
believing that it must be possible to ascertain whether
you are firing at a hospital, which is in one of the big
streets of the town, or not. The complaints of the
inhabitants are universal. Some blame the soldiers and
some blame the revolutionaries, and one hears bitter
stories from both parties about the conduct of their
adversaries. Those on the Government side say:
“What can you do against guerilla bands who dart
round corners, shoot policemen, and run away?” The
others say: “What can you think of people who shoot
down the Red Cross doctors and bombard private
houses?” Again, the supporters of the Government
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>say the revolutionaries use and exploit the Red Cross
and, under the guise of Red Cross men, do murder.
The others say again “The Government hires a Militia
drawn from the Black Hundred to shoot indiscriminately
from the tops of church steeples.” Again
you hear a story like this (I do not vouch for its truth):
A student was surrounded by a mob, and on the point
of being lynched, when he was rescued by a policeman,
and on the way to the police station he shot the policeman.
Or you hear that a number of peaceable citizens
were walking up a street when the soldiery suddenly
appeared and fired up the street indiscriminately. It
must be borne in mind that the people of Moscow had
been fully warned to stay at home as much as possible,
that after six o’clock it was dangerous to go out, and
that groups of three or more people would be fired on
at sight, since the revolutionaries, who wear no uniform
and are indistinguishable from the ordinary passer-by,
took shelter among such groups. A man in a fur coat
may, for all you know, have his pockets full of bombs.
I know three cases of people being accidentally killed:
a little boy ran out of his house, not into the street, but
into the yard of his house to make a slide. As he did
so he was shot by a stray bullet. The proprietor of the
Ermitage Restaurant was also shot on his doorstep
by a stray bullet. Thirdly, Metrofan, a kind of porter
who was a friend of mine, and about whom I wrote in
my last letter, has disappeared, and is not to be found
in any of the hospitals. He was the man—an ex-soldier—who
said that it was impossible to walk about
safely (I laughed at him as he said it), and if he has
been killed—which I trust is not true—he seems to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>have had the clearest presentiment of his fate. He was
sent with a letter to a place where firing was going on.
It is just this sort of people who suffered most: door-keepers
and commissionaires who had to go about their
ordinary business and take the risk of being in dangerous
places. One extraordinarily typical incident was told me
by an eye-witness. A man was walking up the Neglinii
Proiesd, a big street, in which the Ermitage Restaurant
is situated; he was deaf and could not hear the noise
of the firing; after a time he was wounded in the leg.
He saw the blood trickling on the snow, and he made
the sign of the cross and lay down and folded his arms
together, resigning himself to fate. After a time a poodle
came along the street and began sniffing at his head;
this was more than he could bear, and he jumped up
again and, not noticing anything particular going on,
pursued his way quietly home. I think the police
behaved exceedingly well and the soldiers as well as
could be expected. They were not, of course, responsible
for indiscriminate bombardments, which were entirely
due to the military in authority, and not, as is loosely
stated, to the Governor-General, Admiral Dubassov.
In some cases the authorities showed almost inspired
ineptness. For instance, there is a large weaving
factory in Moscow, the workmen of which had not
struck. The police, with Cossacks, made a raid on
it at night to search for arms. They found none;
they ransacked the barracks of the men, and the men
among whose chattels they found leaflets or any
papers they beat. On the next day two-thirds of these
men went on strike. This happened yesterday.
Another case of the sort of thing which happens is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>worth mentioning. There is a house in which a Jew,
a Liberal family, and a rich pork butcher dwell. The
Liberal family have a boy of twelve, who had been
talking about the revolution with pardonable boyish
excess of zeal. The pork butcher said that the whole
place was going to be blown up. On the following day
soldiers arrived and began to shoot at the house. The
owner, on inquiring the reason, received the reply:
“You have got a Jew in the house, and we shall go on
firing till you give us a nachai (a <i><span lang="fr">pourboire</span></i>).” They did
this every day. What the trouble really amounted to
was this: an organised street fight, which lasted a
week (nothing at all approaching either 1832 or 1848 or
1871 in Paris), and which caused a vast deal of damage
to the inhabitants, and inflicted on them a considerable
loss of life, besides pecuniary losses resulting from the
stoppage of trade, &#38;c. In the Paris Commune it
should be remembered that a great many people were
shot in cold blood after it was over, as a punishment,
quite apart from the losses which occurred during the
fighting.</p>

<p class='c011'>I am perfectly convinced, perhaps wrongly, that
the Government is in reality responsible for the troubles,
owing to its dilatoriness in making laws. I know
the answer to this. It is said: “How can you carry
out reforms when the people won’t let you do so—when
the moment they are undertaken a series of strikes
and disturbances begin, and public servants behave in
a manner which would not for a moment be tolerated
in the most progressive of Western nations?” On
the other hand it is obvious that all the strikes and
disturbances which occurred during last year arose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>from the fact of the delay in the granting of reforms.
And now when the people see this delay still existing,
and, rightly or wrongly, argue that nothing has been
given them till they extorted it, it is perhaps natural
that their frame of mind should be one of excited
exasperation. The Government expects them to
behave reasonably, act reasonably, and think reasonably.
They are in a frame of mind when reasonable
action or thought is difficult of attainment, and the
cause of their demented attitude is the action of the
Government in the past. I do not defend them, but
I understand them. My heart is with them; my
head is against them. Their situation seems to me
to resemble that of a man who for years has been
kept on the verge of starvation, and is suddenly
given champagne (liberty of the Press), and is promised
a fixed and daily system of meals, consisting of wholesome
food (Parliament). Then the same people who
starved him begin to be dilatory in starting his new
<i><span lang="fr">régime</span></i>. Is it not easy to understand that the conduct
of such a man would not be likely to be
reasonable? I hope that one of the results of
the events in Moscow will be to make the Government
realise the pressing necessity of taking some
steps to win the confidence of all that is “Moderate”
in Russia. I hope also that it will impress on
all the “Moderates” the necessity of combination
and co-operation; because the revolutionaries
declare that they will strike again in March if they
do not get what they wish, and that the events of
Moscow will be repeated in St. Petersburg. If they decide
on this, no amount of arrests and repression will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>prevent them, and if the private houses of St. Petersburg
are to be subjected to indiscriminate bombardment
the outlook is indeed serious. Other results
are these. The soldiers have been proved to be
loyal, but a Government cannot subsist on bayonets
alone. Again, there will be a large number of workmen
out of work; these men when they go back to
their villages will be met with some such remarks as
these: “No money. You struck? What for? Get out.”</p>

<p class='c011'>These two last mentioned facts should make strikes in
the future more difficult. Some people say that nothing
will pacify the revolutionaries; possibly, but the important
question is, how far will the revolutionaries be
supported by public opinion? That depends entirely on
the action of the Government. It is certainly untrue
to say that public opinion in Moscow was against the
revolutionaries, if it is an exaggeration to say that it
supported them. This leads us to another question:
What do the people here think of it all? In answer I
can only repeat what I said in my last letter: there
exists violent and bitter partisanship on both sides;
there exists also a large class of onlookers which is half-indifferent,
half-resigned, and half-sceptical—in the
main indifferent. But if one is to go by facts one
can point to the small crowd—a selected and, in
some parts, I believe, a paid crowd of men—who
attended the manifestation for the Emperor’s birthday,
the vast crowd which attended Bauman’s funeral, and
the great numbers of working men and others who have
been fighting against the Government these last few
days. When I was talking to the wounded soldiers
to-day in the hospital they told me that they had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>heard from men returning from the Far East that the
reports of a large mutiny in the Army there were
untrue, that there had been discontent about not
coming home and a small rising, but nothing like
what was reported. One man said to me: “We may
ask for more soup and meat, but is it likely we are
going to mutiny for that? They will give us more
if we ask for it; soldiers can’t strike, it is as if the
whole population were to strike.” I refrained from
pointing out that this is what exactly had occurred
in October. I answered by my simile of the starving
man who is suddenly given champagne.</p>

<p class='c011'>To-day I tried the Sortes Virgilianæ with regard to

to the Soldiers’ Hospital. One of them asked me
whether Paris was in Turkey. He said the Turks

<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>a place where it was all water. I described Venice as
best I could. On my way to the hospital I went to

that he had told his comrades all about it, and had said
he would have been lost had not the Lord sent him
a Barine, and such a Barine too! (I had heavily overpaid
him.) I said, “I suppose you said, ‘God sent you
a fool.’” “Oh! Barine, don’t offend God,” he answered.
The cabmen are a constant source of amusement to me
here. The other day, when I was driving, the cabman
stopped and made another one stop to admire his horse.
After we drove on again, we kept on meeting again, and
every time we met we slowed down, and the conversation
about the horse and how much it had cost was
continued.</p>

<p class='c011'>From having had much conversation with people who

and exaggerated terms. If I am with violent Conservatives

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>I arrived at St. Petersburg this morning. I
have been trying to formulate my reactionary
feelings. I will put them on paper; although I know
I shall only have to spend a very short time with real
reactionaries to be driven straight back into the opposite
camp. But lately at Moscow I have had a heavy dose
of anti-governmental unfairness. Too heavy for the
present, although perhaps I shall one day in the future
think that it was not unfair at all.</p>

<p class='c011'>I asked a man the other day, who is employed in the
“Zemstva,” what party he belonged to. “I belong to
the party of common sense,” he answered; “unfortunately
it does not exist.” This exactly sums up, I
think, the impression that any impartial observer must
necessarily derive from the present situation in Russia.
Common sense has gone. Hysteria and undisciplined
rant have taken its place.</p>

<p class='c011'>First, the revolutionaries. There are two kinds of
revolutionaries: the active, who throw bombs at policemen
and soldiers, who are ready to dare anything and
sacrifice themselves; and the passive revolutionaries
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>who sit at home and sympathise and talk a great deal.
What is their point of view?</p>

<p class='c011'>1. They consider that all classes who are not
definitely enrolled under their flag are violent reactionaries
and are fit to be classed with the “Black
Hundred.”  The Duma that is to be, they say, will
be a “Black Hundred” Duma; the present Government
is purely and simply a reactionary Government
composed of bureaucrats, and no good can come to
Russia until the ulcer is pierced to the core, and all
bureaucrats, together with the Emperor and all his
family, and all his Court, are removed. The objection
that the present Government is merely temporary
until the Duma assembles, they meet with the counterargument
that the Government, with the franchise
law as it is, is capable of influencing the elections to
any extent, and that the result will be a reactionary
Duma.</p>

<p class='c011'>2. The second question is—What do they want?
They say they want a Constituent Assembly and
universal suffrage, and no doubt they do want this.
But whether they would be satisfied with this if they
were given it is another question.  Personally, my
experience has so far led me to believe that they would
in no wise be satisfied with this; I would lay odds
to this effect. I may, no doubt, be mistaken. I believe
what they really want is for Russia to become a
federation of autonomous States represented by a
Republic.  Some of the more moderate are either
opposed to this or refrain from stating any opinion
in favour of it, owing to the fact that they know that
the Army and ninety million peasants are ready to kill
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>any one within reach if the “Gasudar” is to be
tampered with.</p>

<p class='c011'>They fear that if the question of a Republic is
brought forward there will be a general massacre
of the educated bourgeoisie, the so-called “Intelligenzia.”
Nothing is more probable. Some people
say that nothing will really change the attitude of
these people: no more than any amount of measures
which one of Lord Salisbury’s Cabinets might have
adopted would have changed the opinion of the supporters
of Mr. Gladstone or Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman,
or <i><span lang="la">vice versâ</span></i>. That it is utterly futile
to expect common sense or common fairness from them.
That they have their party feeling, to which they are
ready to sacrifice everything, and that it is infinitely
stronger and more bitter, and necessarily stronger
and more bitter, than anything of which we have had
experience in England during the last century.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some people object that they understand the militant
revolutionaries being in this frame of mind, but they
do not understand the more intelligent passive and
detached supporters of the advanced party sharing such
childish views. The more intelligent and detached supporters
are even more violent in their talk than the
militant fighters. At present the kind of argument one
hears used is like the following, which I have heard
with my own ears. I have heard intelligent cultivated
people say: “How wicked and cowardly of the Government
to fire upon the revolutionaries, since they have
guns and the revolutionaries haven’t got any.” The
English mind, which, be it Liberal or Conservative,
tends to common sense, revolts against such reasoning.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>It is rare to find in Russia an Englishman who sympathises
with the revolutionaries. English common
sense revolts at the hysterical impatience which demands
the immediate fulfilment of measures more radical and
socialist than exist in any European state, and the
common British sense of fairness is violated at hearing
of the wanton murder of policemen, who earn a poor
living and are in no way responsible for the misdeeds
of the Government, exalted as a patriotic execution
worthy of Harmodius and Aristogiton.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the other hand I think we fail—I am alluding
to Englishmen who visit Russia, and not to those who
live here permanently—to realise that the Russians
have been up to now destitute of certain guarantees
which Englishmen regard as a matter of course,
and that they do not consider they have obtained these
guarantees yet; and here it is difficult to contradict
them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lately an incident happened which has proved a
kind of focussing glass concentrating the opinions of
both parties. The revolutionaries walked into the
house of the head of the detective police service,
dragged him from his family circle and shot him.
Somewhat later a police officer named Ermolov walked
into the house of a doctor and shot him before his
wife’s eyes. The officer gave himself up to the authorities
and said his act was due to momentary aberration.
Around these incidents both parties wage a war of
tongues. The sympathisers with the revolutionaries
talk of the martyrdom of the doctor; whereas their
opponents say that the fuss they are making is unjustifiable
since they did the very same thing.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>Personally I think that the weak side of the Government
case is this: that the revolutionaries are sure
of punishment if caught; whereas the official who
does wrong is not punished, and his wrong-doing is
surely more heinous because he is the representative
of the law. On the other hand I think the wanton
murder of policemen has nothing of the heroic in it,
and when I hear it spoken of in terms of admiration
I am disgusted.</p>

<p class='c011'>As to the opponents of the revolutionaries, they also
attack the Government, and especially Count Witte.
They say that the only supporters of Count Witte
are foreigners. The <cite>Slovo</cite> newspaper said, for instance,
that foreigners only supported Count Witte because
they desired the enfeeblement of Russia. But reactionaries
say that the Russian revolution is entirely
fostered and supported by a foreign Government. Now
it cannot be to the French Government’s interest for
Russia’s credit to collapse, nor can it be to the German
Government’s interest for Russia to become a federation
of autonomous States; therefore it must be the English
Government, and, when pressed, they admit this. But if
the English Press is trying to ruin Russia by supporting
Count Witte, it is obvious that it cannot be at the
same time trying to ruin Russia by supporting the
revolutionaries. One of these two statements must
be untrue; quite apart from the question as to whether
the collapse of Russia’s credit would prove a material
advantage to England. The fact is that the reactionaries
who talk in this strain are politically limited in
their ideas; they know practically nothing either of
England or of any other country, they merely repeat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>old catchwords and musty traditions which have been
proved to be absurd.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now apart from these reactionary Jingoes, who are
really of no importance whatsoever now, there is a large
class of people who six months ago would have been
called red revolutionaries, and who now call themselves
“Moderates,” and are called by the revolutionaries
members of the “Black Gang.”</p>

<p class='c011'>These people wish for the most speedy fulfilment
of the Manifesto of the 17th of October; they blame
the Government for its delay in making laws, and they
blame Count Witte. But they look upon the Duma as
being competent to settle the various aspirations of the
various parties. They should be a strong party; the
trouble is that up to the present time they have never
seen their way either to support the Government or
to form a homogeneous party among themselves. It
is possible that the recent events at Moscow may have
the effect of causing them to coalesce. It is to be
hoped that this will happen; for in them lies the safe
<i><span lang="la">via media</span></i> between the two extremes of reaction and
anarchy.</p>

<p class='c011'>It will be noticed that all these various parties are
united with regard to one detail, that is in their blame
of Count Witte. It is also worth mentioning that in
all the innumerable attacks made on Count Witte
nobody has so far had the ingenuity or the perspicacity
to name his possible successor. Would the revolutionaries
really like him to go? I doubt it. They would
have, in the first place, nobody to attack; in the second
place, they would risk having a more reactionary successor.
For that reason I have never up to now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>believed in any of the countless reports regarding
Count Witte’s immediate resignation.</p>

<p class='c011'>At present the Government is feeling extremely
confident owing to the way in which recent events
have turned out; the revolutionaries also profess to
be in no wise disheartened; they say that the Moscow
rising is nothing in comparison with what they will do
in March, and that seeing that they have exhausted
the efficacy of strikes and armed risings they will adopt
the method of terrorism and blow up Government
buildings with dynamite (in March). I have heard
intelligent sympathisers with the revolutionaries talking
of such a policy with enthusiasm, saying that this is
the only way to deal with the Government, and that
the Duma, such as it will be, is not only of no account
but will never come into existence.</p>

<p class='c011'>These people are members of the Russian “Intelligenzia,”
or middle professional class. They have many
admirable qualities, and I live among them and like
them; but I think that sometimes some of their
members talk most wildly and ought to know better.
Up to now, of course, they have been carefully prevented
by the Government from taking any part in
politics whatsoever, and they feel now that vast possibilities
have been opened to them; that it is they who
made the revolution, and that it is they who are going to
rule the country.</p>

<p class='c011'>Only at present they have not succeeded in producing
a great man. They arrogate to themselves the position
of sole spokesmen and representatives of the Russian
people, and at this also common sense revolts. For
apart from the fact of the peasants distrusting them, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>the Army hating them, what have they done for Russia?
Possibly it was not they who brought about the
Constitution. They class the whole gentry and aristocracy
with the Bureaucrats under one sweeping ban
of blame and abuse; but the gentry laid the foundations
of reform and revolution long before they existed as
a class at all (<i><span lang="la">vide</span></i> the Decembrists, 1825). Moreover,
the gentry gave to Russia Poushkin, Lermontov, Gogol,
Tolstoi, Turgeniev, Tchaikovski, and Dostoievski; in
fact, her literature, her art, her music, her poetry; all
her great men and men of genius. In the sphere of
the arts they have made Russia hideous by importing
a debased <em>art nouveau</em> from Munich; and in the sphere
of literature they have produced some excellent writers
of short stories. In verse (the verse of such writers as
“Skitaletzt” is weaker than the prose of Andreev and
Co.) the English equivalent would be the political
poetry of Mr. Alfred Austin; the political tendencies
of the Russian writers, of course, differ widely from
that of the English Laureate, whose work, although
it has met with public recognition, would, perhaps, have
made England less famous as a literary nation were
it the sole representative of our poetical literature.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now that I have disburdened myself on the subject
of the unfairness of the “Intelligenzia,” I feel better.
According to the oriental fashion I should at once
add counter-arguments giving all that there is to be
said in their favour. This I will do another day.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>To-day is the Russian New Year’s Day. To-day
is also Sunday, so it would seem a fitting
occasion to preach a long sermon on Russia. I have
been amusing myself by finding suitable texts for such
a sermon. They are all from the works of Renan, a
man who gave a good deal of thought to the various
political movements and phases of the world’s history,
and expressed himself with that nice lucidity and
divine ease which we call a perfect style.</p>

<p class='c011'>The first is this: “<span lang="fr">La Révolution française fut la
gageure d’un petit nombre d’énergumènes qui réussirent
à faire croire qu’ils avaient entraîné la nation.</span>”</p>

<p class='c011'>No. 2: “<span lang="fr">Éternelle puérilité des répressions pénales,
appliquées aux choses de l’âme.</span>”</p>

<p class='c011'>No. 3: “<span lang="fr">Dans ses accès de vertu, l’homme croit
pouvoir se passer entièrement de l’égoisme et de
l’intérêt propre; l’égoisme prend sa revanche, en prouvant
que l’absolu désintéressement engendre des maux
plus graves que ceux qu’on avait cru éviter par la
suppression de la propriété.</span>”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>These are my texts, and, as is usually the case when
the text is good, the sermon is superfluous.</p>

<p class='c011'>New Year’s Day is, we are so often told, a good
occasion to look forward and behind. What, then, is
the outlook at present? Life is going on at St. Petersburg
and Moscow exactly as usual, and here, save in
the smouldering ruins of the factory of the Presnaya
and various broken windows and damaged cornices,
there is nothing to tell one that anything unusual has
occurred. The Government is said to be confident.
Foreign loans are in the air. The revolutionaries, it
is said, have been crushed and dispersed. Electioneering
work is beginning; in fact, all is going as well
as can be expected. That is one view—an optimistic
view which I do not altogether share. In the first
place, when people say that the Revolutionary Party or
its leaders are a minority I would reply by quoting text
No. 1. “Laws, in a country which is following an idea,
are always made by the minority,” says Renan, immediately
before the sentence I have quoted.</p>

<p class='c011'>Secondly, the Moscow episode does not seem to me
to have affected the revolutionary movement in the
slightest degree. The numbers of the killed among
the insurgents were trifling; all the important and
real leaders of the Revolution had left Moscow before
this affair, which was, in fact, conducted by boys and
girls; and if a number of boys and girls can, at the
head of a mass of workmen, bring the garrison to distraction,
take guns from the troops, and force the
authorities to bombard the houses of the inhabitants
without raising universal indignation, things must be
fairly serious.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>To say that they have alienated public sympathy is
certainly untrue; for although they started the fighting,
as soon as the authorities answered with artillery the
common ordinary man in the street began in many
cases to say that it was the fault of the Government
and the authorities. Sympathy in Russia is always
certain to be with the people who are shot, be they
right or wrong.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Whatever happens, we have got</div>
      <div class='line'>The Maxim-gun and they have not.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>That is, they argue, the motto of the authorities, and
that is exactly the sentiment which arouses the indignation
of the citizen. A cabman asked some one the
other day when they were going to punish “him.”
Who is “him”? he was asked. “Admiral Dubassov,”
was the answer. “Surely the Emperor will punish him
for shooting at the houses.” The energetic manner
in which the rising was suppressed has, I am told,
produced a good effect in Europe; doubtless energetic
measures were not only necessary but imperative in
the first instance; whether the continuation of them
now is a mistake or not only the future can show.
One fact, however, is certain, and that is that these
measures are being conducted with the same arbitrariness
which has characterised the action of the Russian
police in the past, and are causing intense exasperation.
There is a word in Russian, “Proisvol,” which means
acting, like Wordsworth’s river, according to your
“own sweet will,” unheedful of, and often in defiance
of, the law. It is precisely this manner of acting which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>has brought about the revolution in Russia. It is
against the “Proisvol” that all the educated classes
and half the official class rebelled. And it is this very
“Proisvol” against which the whole country rose on
strike, which the Government promised should henceforth
disappear, and which is at the present moment
triumphantly installed once more as the ruling system.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of course it may be objected that anarchy and lawless
revolution can only be met by severe repression;
but the question is: Must it be met by arbitrary and
lawless repression? Hang the insurgents if you like,
but why shoot a doctor who has got nothing to do
with it before you know anything about him? To stop
a newspaper like the <cite>Russkie Viedomosti</cite>, for instance,
is an act of sheer “Proisvol,” the reason given being
that it had subscription lists for workmen’s unions,
which it denies, saying that the money was for the
wounded. Here I point to my second text. All this
repression seems to me utterly futile. The future,
however, can show whether this is indeed so.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the meantime election programmes are appearing.
That of the Constitutional Democrats has come out,
and is moderate in tone, although its clauses are
extensive. It insists, among other things, on universal
suffrage and an eight-hours’ day for the workmen.
Here I would point to text 3. Everybody whom I
have seen in Russia in any way connected with the
working man is agreed in saying that an eight-hours’
day is an absolute impossibility. That a Russian
workman’s eight hours means in reality about six
hours. That no factory in Russia could exist on these
terms. The Constitutional Democrats seem in this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>case to have omitted the factor of human egoism and
interest.</p>

<p class='c011'>One of the gravest factors of the general situation is
that Eastern Siberia seems to be entirely in the hands
of the revolutionaries, who are apparently managing
the railway and everything else with perfect order,
while the troops, anxious only to get home, are taking
any engines they can lay hands on and racing back,
one train literally racing another!</p>

<p class='c011'>Altogether it cannot be said that the outlook is
particularly cheerful. There is one bright point so far,
and that is that all parties seem anxious to convoke
the Duma. The Liberals want it, the Conservatives
want it, the Extreme Radicals sanction the elections.
The Radicals say it will be packed by the Government;
but I do not see how this is possible. They
say they will let it meet, and that if it proves “a Black
Hundred Duma” they will destroy it. They call everything
which is not Radical “Black Hundred.” But, as
I have said before, and as I cannot tire of saying, it
is useless to blame these extreme parties for talking
nonsense. They have been driven to this nonsense
by the still greater want of sense on the part of the
Government of Russia during the last twenty years,
and in wanting to wipe out this system altogether
they are, after all, in the right. Unfair they may be,
hysterical, and absurd. So were the Jacobins; but the
absurdity, extravagance, and violence of the Jacobins
were only the logical result of the “Ancien Régime.”
So it is here, although it is misleading to compare the
present movement in Russia with the French Revolution.</p>

<p class='c011'>And behind all the rumours and conflicts of various
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>parties looms the agrarian question; the ninety million
peasants who till the land in the same manner in which
they tilled it four hundred years ago; whose land from
generation to generation dwindles by partition, while
the population increases. How and when is this question
going to be solved? It can only be solved by the
education of the peasants themselves; but the question
is what can be done to gain time and to make this
education possible. My outlook is, perhaps, too pessimistic.
I do not know. I only feel that the whole
revolutionary movement is beyond all forces of control,
and that no measures in the world can put it back
now; whether it could by wisdom be led into safe
channels is another question. Such a thing has seldom
been seen in the history of the world, and it is, after
all, only out of the past that we make the future.</p>

<p class='c011'>To get rid of these gloomy ideas I went to the
hospital, where New Year’s Day was celebrated with
great gusto; there was a Christmas-tree, dancing and
song, and it was delightful to see a little tiny boy and
a huge soldier dancing opposite each other. The
Russian peasants dance to each other, and separately,
of course, like Highlanders when they dance a reel or
a schottische. It was gay and yet rather melancholy;
there were so many cripples, and it reminded me a
little of the Christmas feast described in Dostoievski’s
“Letters from a Dead House.”</p>

<p class='c011'>To-day I heard a characteristic story. A student
told it to me. A peasant was looking at a rich man’s
house in one of the streets of Moscow. An agitator
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>went up to him and said: “Think of the rich man
living in that great house, and think of your miserable
position.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” said the peasant cheerfully, “it’s a big house;
he’s a proper Barine.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But,” said the agitator, much irritated, “it’s most
unjust that he should live in such a big house and
that you should live in a small house. You should
turn him out of it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How could that be?” answered the peasant. “He
is used to being rich. All his life he has lived in
plenty. What would he do in poverty? We are
used to poverty, and we must have pity on those who
are not used to it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The agitator then gave the peasant up and went
away in disgust.</p>

<p class='c011'>I arrived in St. Petersburg this morning. Yesterday
a Russian friend of mine discussed with me my ideas
on the “Intelligenzia” and their revolutionary sympathies
which I had embodied in a letter to the
<cite>Morning Post</cite>. My friend said that I had committed
a gross injustice to the Russian “Intelligenzia,” and that
my letter, by reflecting the opinion of Englishmen
who had spent but a short time in Russia, and judged
everything from the point of view of a country where
political liberty had long since been an established
fact, gave a wrong impression. There is some truth
in this, no doubt. It is difficult here to keep a cool
head and not to be swayed by circumambient influence.
The danger does not lie in being influenced by those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>who immediately surround one, but rather in being
influenced inversely by their opinions. I mean one
has only to talk to a revolutionary or to a conservative
long enough, at the present moment, to be convinced
that his adversary is right. I still hold, however, to
what I wrote about the unfairness and exaggerations
of the sympathisers with the revolution among the
“Intelligenzia.” I think they are incapable of looking
at the matter impartially, and no wonder. Moreover,
the Government past and present is responsible for
their frame of mind. Again, I still hold to what I
said, that the “Intelligenzia” have not produced a
great man; but instead of retracting what I said, I
will, as I said I would do, after the oriental fashion,
having stated all that there was to be said against
them, try and set forth all that is to be said in favour
of the “Intelligenzia.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In the first place, what is the “Intelligenzia”?
Properly speaking, it is composed of every one who
can read or write. But the term is generally used
to designate those members of the middle class who
belong to the professional classes—doctors, professors,
teachers, journalists, and literary men. In its largest
sense it is the whole middle class, from which nine-tenths
of the officials are drawn. But when Russians
speak of it they generally mean the middle class,
excluding officials. Such as it is, it contains, as well
as the most hot-headed revolutionaries and violent
youths, all that is best and most intelligent and
cultivated in Russia, all men of science who have
done remarkable work in various branches, all doctors,
whose life in the country is a life of difficulty and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>self-sacrifice which it would be difficult to exaggerate,
all the professors and the teachers, the actors, the singers,
the musicians, the artists, the writers. These people
have for years been the absolute prey of the irresponsibility
and blundering stupidity of the higher
bureaucrats. They have with difficulty been able to
obtain foreign books (Matthew Arnold’s “Essays on
Criticism” was one of the books on the index two
years ago); in teaching, half the facts of history have
been forbidden them; and at the slightest suspicion
of not being “well-intentioned” they have been placed
under police surveillance and often been subjected
to gross indignities. Is it to be wondered at that
they are bitter now? The average man and woman
of the Russian middle class is incomparably better
educated than the average English man or woman
of the same class. They are saturated with the foreign
classics. They often speak two languages besides
Russian; and they are conversant with modern thought
in the various European countries as far as it is
allowed to reach them. When one sees the average
Englishman abroad one is aghast at his ignorance
and his want of education in comparison with these
people. I have constantly, both here and in Manchuria,
found to my shame that I knew nothing of
English history in comparison with the Russians I met.
The reason is very simple: they are taught at school
things which will be useful to them. Every one is
given a general foundation of knowledge. I do not
believe the average Englishman to be more stupid
than the average foreigner, but he is not educated.
A man may go through a public school and even a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>university in England and come out at the end
ludicrously ignorant of everything except the classical
books he was obliged to “get up,” and at our public
schools, with a few brilliant exceptions, the education
of the average boy amounts to this: that he does
not learn Latin and Greek, and he certainly learns
nothing else. I never heard English history mentioned
at Eton, and all the English history I know I learnt
in the nursery. The average Russian boy knows far
more about English history than the average English
boy, let alone European history; and a cultivated
Russian of the middle class is saturated with John Stuart
Mill, Herbert Spencer, Ruskin, John Morley, Buckle,
and Carlyle; whereas Shakespeare, Milton, Byron, and
Shelley are treated as Russian classics. Only yesterday
I travelled with a man who, although he could not speak
English, was intimately conversant with our whole
literature, and told me that the whole generation to
which he belonged had been taught to find their intellectual
food in England and not in France and Germany.
“How is it,” he asked me, “that we Russians who live
on English thought, and admire and respect you
as a nation far more than other nations, have been
so long at loggerheads with you politically?” I said
that I thought the reason was that, although the
cultivated and the average educated Russian knows
our literature well, the nation as a whole does not
know us, and we do not know Russia at all—for most
intelligent Englishmen are ludicrously ignorant of
Russia. Besides this, the bureaucratic <i><span lang="fr">régime</span></i> has
acted like a barrier between the two countries and
fostered and fed on the misunderstanding.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>As far as politics are concerned things have moved
on. Some weeks ago it was possible to believe that
the Government had been wantonly hampered in its
well-intentioned efforts, now it is only too plain that
by their acts they are doing their best to justify the
violence of the revolutionaries. The “Proisvol” (arbitrariness)
continues on an extensive scale. People
in Moscow are arrested every day and without discrimination.
Influential people do not dare to inscribe
their names on the lists of the Constitutional Democratic
Party for fear of being arrested. The police have
unlimited powers, and all the methods of the old <i><span lang="fr">régime</span></i>
are flourishing once more. I do not believe, as is sure
to be objected, that the action of the revolutionaries
has rendered this necessary. I do not believe that the
best way to fight revolution is by lawless and arbitrary
repression. Lastly, and most important, it is not the
immorality or the illegality of the methods that I find
reprehensible, but their stupidity and ineffectiveness.
If all this repression were the iron working of one great
central mind, which ruthlessly imposed its will on the
nation, breaking down all obstacles and restoring order,
it would be excusable. But it is not. I do not believe
the Government is responsible for what happens in
Moscow; and in Moscow itself the various authorities
shift the responsibility on to each other. It is the old
story of the bureaucratic system—no responsibility and
no individual efficiency, but a happy-go-lucky, drifting,
and blind incompetence, striking where it should not
strike, being lenient too late, and never foreseeing what
is under its very nose. When one comes to think,
it is not surprising, considering that the instruments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>with which Count Witte has to deal are of the old
regulation bureaucratic pattern. How, for instance,
can the Minister of the Interior, M. Durnovo, be
expected to adopt any other methods than those which
are ingrained in him? It is as if the Liberals persuaded
Mr. Chamberlain to speak at a public meeting and then
expressed surprise at finding that he was in favour of
Tariff Reform. When some of the revolutionaries were
summarily executed after the recent troubles in Moscow,
a sentence of Tacitus came back to me which is
peculiarly applicable to the old Russian bureaucratic
methods: “<span lang="la">Interfectis Varrone consule designate et
Petronio Turpiliano consulari&#160;... inauditi atque indefensi
tamquam innocentes perierunt</span>” (Varro and
Turpilianus were executed without trial and defence,
so that they might just as well have been innocent).</p>

<p class='c011'>The whole system of arresting doctors and professors,
prohibiting newspapers and plays, censoring books and
songs, is now, whatever may have been its effect in
the past, childishly futile. Moreover, even this is
blunderingly done. The harmless newspapers are
suppressed and more violent ones appear. But the
point is the futility of it all; as soon as a serious newspaper
is stopped it reappears on the next day under
another name. Each repressed satirical newspaper
(and these journals are often exceedingly scurrilous)
finds a successor. It is not as if the revolutionaries
were the result of the newspapers; it is the newspapers
which are the reflection of the revolutionaries; and
until you can repress every revolutionary the spirit
which finds its vent in these organs will exist. To
repress the Liberal spirit altogether it will be necessary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>to suppress nearly all the thinking population of Russia.
The only hope is that all this is, after all, only temporary,
and that the meeting of the Duma will put an end
to this riot of lawlessness and inefficiency. One competent
man like Count Witte is not enough to deal
with things which are happening all over the country
in so large a place as Russia, and he is bound to trust
himself to minor authorities—and these in many cases
prove themselves unfit for their task. “Why are they
chosen?” it may be asked. The answer is: “Who else
is there to choose until the whole pack of cards is
thoroughly reshuffled or rather destroyed, and a new
pack, men chosen by the Duma, is adopted?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But,” it is objected, “however much you reshuffle
the cards, the pack will be the same.” This is true;
but one radical change would make all the difference
in the world, and that would be the introduction of
the system of responsibility. Whenever there has been
in a Russian town a governor who had declared his
firm intention of holding his subordinates responsible
for their acts, and has put such a declaration into
practice, things have always gone well. There was for
years a chief of the police at Moscow, who was just
such a man. The trouble is now, that however good
a subordinate official may be, there is no guarantee
that he may not be removed at any minute owing to
the passing whim of those who are above.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>People are now saying that the revolutionary
movement in Russia has suffered a complete
defeat. I do not share this point of view; my reason
is not based upon prophetic discernment into the
future, but on what has happened in the past.</p>

<p class='c011'>If we are in the presence of a stream and note the
beginnings of its turbulent course, and then observe that
it has met with the obstacle of a dam and burst through
that obstacle, and that this occurrence has been repeated
six times, with the result that every time the dam has
been burst the stream has gathered in strength, when this
dam is made a seventh time we are justified in concluding
that as the dam is the same in kind as it was before,
and the stream also, the stream will break through
it a seventh time, although every time the dam was
made the onlookers made the observation that the progress
of the stream was definitively impeded. Now
this is precisely what has happened with regard to the
Russian revolutionary movement up to the present
time. And we are now witnessing an act of a drama
which began in 1895.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>The course of events was like this: When the Emperor
Nicholas II. came to the Throne a deputation of the
Zemstva were told that their moderate demands for the
beginning of reform were senseless dreams. Upon these
words the first dam was built, and it took the form of
universal repression.</p>

<p class='c011'>In December, 1904, the ukase, embodying the nullified
projects of Prince Mirsky, was immediately followed by
a threatening Manifesto, and a second dam was made.
This dam, however, was ineffectual, and it was followed
by the rising of the workmen of the 9th of January, and
when this meeting was dispersed by the troops, and a third
dam constructed, people said—and among them people
who lived here and ought to have known better—that
the Russian revolution was over. February 18th saw
the publication of the two contradictory Manifestoes and
the Boulygin project, and during this time the dam took
the shape of the Trepoff dictatorship, which, as General
Trepoff is a competent man, proved to be for the time
being more effectual than the obstacles which had
hitherto been employed.</p>

<p class='c011'>However, in spite of this there came the incidents of
the mutiny on board the <em>Kniaz Potemkin</em> and at Kronstadt
and Libau. This was followed by the concession
of the law giving the Duma on August 6th, which was
accompanied by a law forbidding public meetings. A
fourth dam had been made. But the current only
increased in strength. The Agrarian movement began.
The Labour movement increased. Meetings took place
everywhere till the dam burst, owing to the fact that the
whole of Russia went on strike in October, 1905.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then the Manifesto of the 17th of October was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>given—a Manifesto granting freedom of meeting and of
speech, but no laws. It was followed by the declaration
of martial law in Poland. This measure was in its turn
succeeded by the St. Petersburg strike, the Sevastopol
mutiny, and a violent agrarian agitation in the province of
Saratov, which spread all over the “black soil” country in
Russia. Repressive measures followed. The Zemstvo
leaders then addressed themselves to Count Witte, and
asked for a cessation of repressive measures, the control
of irresponsible bureaucrats in the provinces, and the
right of universal suffrage. This was refused. The
postal officials, who had formed a union, were arrested;
there ensued postal strikes in St. Petersburg and Moscow.
Thereupon a law was promulgated—this was the
fifth dam—by which each provincial governor could
declare his government to be outside the law. This was
followed by the armed rising in Moscow, and after this
a sixth dam was made by the adoption of repressive
measures of arrest all over Russia.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now, such questions as whether the revolutionary
party was right or wrong; whether they were too much
in a hurry, and too impulsive and violent in their
methods; whether postal officials and Government
servants are justified in striking, &#38;c., are altogether
beside the mark. The fact is that they have six times
been successful in bursting the barrier which has been
placed to oppose them. And now once again people
are saying that because the movement has been temporarily
checked—because a dam has been made—the
movement is over; that the stream will not be able
to continue its course. This is where I take leave to
differ from those who have from the first predicted the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>ultimate collapse of the revolutionary movement. I
differed then—in January, 1905—and I continue to
differ now. I am aware that I am laying myself open
to the charge of prophesying. “When you keep a
diary,” said a shrewd observer of a past generation,
“don’t write down public events which you can find in
any record, but put down what you think will happen,
and then you will be astonished to see how wrong you
have been.”</p>

<p class='c011'>I have been amusing myself by putting down some
current ideas—those of some people I have met here and
some of my own, in the form of a dialogue. The people
represented are not real people. They are scarcely
even types, but mere mouthpieces of current ideas. I
have not tried to describe a conversation such as one
now hears in Russia, but I have attempted to put in the
form of dialogue certain ideas I have heard expressed
by my friends and certain opinions which have occurred
to myself during such intercourse.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There are three parties I could belong to,” said the
small landlord; “the alliance of October 17th, the
alliance of Right and Order, and the Constitutional
Democratic Party. I would be willing to support any
one of these three, in the hope that they would lead
directly or indirectly to the disappearance of the present
dynasty and to the establishment of a real autocracy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The student laughed. “The Constitutional Democrats
will not lead you to an autocracy of any kind,”
he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am not so sure,” said the landlord. “Napoleon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>was the child of the Revolution, and so was Cromwell.
I support the Radicals in the same way in which I
would have supported the Puritans to get rid of Charles
I., and make way for Cromwell.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And Charles II.?” asked the professor, who had just
returned from a prolonged stay in England.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Precisely, and Charles II.,” said the landlord. “The
Charles the Firsts of history are invincibly ignorant,
whereas the Charles the Seconds have learned the
lesson and make ideal monarchs. One cannot always
be governed by men of genius, and in the intervening
period, when the genius is absent, I prefer to be
governed by a man of the world, such as Charles II. or
Louis XVIII., rather than by demagogues and idealists.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is better to be governed by honest demagogues
and idealists than by dishonest Bureaucrats,” said the
student. “The Bureaucrats made the war.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“When the war was declared you students marched
cheering into the streets, and I myself happening to be
in uniform that day—I am in the Reserve—was carried
in reluctant triumph on the shoulders of an enthusiastic
crowd. The war can be blamed, not because it was
immoral, for it was not more immoral than any other
war, but because it was made too late, and because it
was unsuccessful.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The war,” said the professor, “was a war made by
irresponsible capitalists, in the same way as the South
African War was the work of a gang of financiers, and
had a true Englishman of genius, such as Gladstone
or Bright, been alive, the war would not have been
possible.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” said the student, “the feeling here was never so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>great against England during this war as during the war
in South Africa.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The English,” answered the landlord, “made the
same mistake as we did; they knew nothing about
South Africa, and made the war later than they should
have done; had they waited longer the Afrikander
element would have probably turned them out of South
Africa altogether, and they would have lost their prestige
and their Colonies. Bismarck foresaw this, and
hoped that it might happen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The English have gained nothing by having betrayed
their ancient tradition, and sacrificed to false gods,” said
the professor, “but now they are returning to the true
path, and it is to Liberal England that we must look for
example and support.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You mean,” said the landlord, “that one set of men,
including some bright intellects and a number of average,
that is to say, mediocre men, have been replaced by
another set of men containing exactly the same proportion
of capacity, mediocrity, and incompetence. By
what miracle are they to govern the country better or
worse than their opponents? Have they shown that
they could do so in the past? And I would apply this
argument to the situation here. Do you imagine that a
Ministry composed of intellectuals would be radically
different from a Ministry composed of Bureaucrats? The
intellectuals will be merely Bureaucrats who have not
learnt their business, and when they have learnt their
business they will be Bureaucrats; that is, perhaps,
why the Zemstvo leaders were reluctant to enter the
Cabinet.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The Zemstvo leaders were reluctant to join Count
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>Witte because they disapproved of his programme,”
said the student, “and, whether they become Bureaucrats
or no, they will be under the control of society.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The Bureaucrats are blamed for lawlessness,” said
the landlord, “but the revolutionaries seem to me so
entirely incapable of controlling themselves that they do
not lead one to believe in their capacity for controlling
other people. The fact is that we Russians are all a
mixture of lawlessness and apathy. We are blamed for
our apathy, for our want of co-operation, but I thank
Heaven for it, for did it not exist, the lawlessness would
lead to excesses of a dangerous character; as it is, there
is no country where an individual can enjoy such a
degree of personal freedom as in Russia. Russia is the
only country where the words liberty, fraternity, and
equality have any reality. These things are facts in
Russia. But they are not facts in England. First, as
regards liberty. There is no liberty either of thought
or <i><span lang="fr">mœurs</span></i> in England. Liberty of thought flourishes
under an autocracy; in the reign of Nero, Renan tells
us, ‘<span lang="fr">la liberté de penser ne fit que gagner. Cette liberté-là
se trouve toujours mieux d’avoir affaire à un roi ou à un
prince qu’à des bourgeois jaloux et bornés.</span>’ I do not
consider my liberty of thought to be violated if I can
only read an eclipsed version of the leading articles of
the English and French halfpenny Press; but I do
consider it violated if I am forbidden to witness a
masterpiece full of thought and moral import, such as
Ibsen’s ‘Ghosts’ or a beautiful play like Mæterlinck’s
‘Monna Vanna.’ This is the case in England. The
English fetter themselves with convention, and ostracise
those who revolt against the convention. You cannot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>smoke in a railway refreshment room in England. You
must dress for dinner. You cannot have supper after
12.30 a.m. at a restaurant. You cannot go to a theatre
on Sunday. You cannot admire anything unless it is
the fashion, and once it is the fashion you must admire
it. As to equality, the whole of English life is a struggle
to belong to the layer of society immediately above your
own, and not to be suspected of belonging to that
immediately beneath your own. Hence England is the
paradise of snobbery, social and intellectual. There is a
mad race to be ‘in the swim’ socially and ‘in the
know’ intellectually, and to read the right books and
admire the right pictures. As to equality I will give
you a concrete instance. Let two men get drunk in
London, one a rich man and the other a poor man. If
they make a disturbance and get taken up, the rich man,
by taking a little trouble, will get the matter hushed up.
The poor man will not get off. You will say that there
is one law for the rich and one for the poor in every
country. But I say that here in Russia nobody cares if
you go drunk in the street, and that, whether you are
rich or poor, if you do so the same thing will happen to
you; you will be taken to the <em>uchastok</em> and kept
there till you get sober. Whereas in England
they care very much; you have to appear before
a magistrate—but the rich man will get out of this.
As to fraternity, the English hedge themselves
round with every kind of social prejudice and barrier
they can devise. Their clubs are like their prisons,
places where it is forbidden to speak to your neighbour,
except under special circumstances, and where you
have to wear a special costume. A Russian convict
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>enjoys a greater freedom of social intercourse than
an English shopman. I judge from their books.
Read ‘Kipps,’ by H. G. Wells. It is a record of
leaden social tyranny.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What you call convention,” said the professor, “is
merely the maintenance of order. It may be exaggerated,
but an exaggeration in this sense is preferable
to one in the other. You can sup here at a restaurant
all night, but a man may shoot you for not being
brisk enough in your manifestation of loyalty.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Many Englishmen would gladly shoot Mr. Bernard
Shaw for the same offence,” said the landlord, “but
they have not the courage of their convictions.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What you call freedom,” said the professor, “is
precisely the opposite of freedom. It is lawlessness.
Your neighbour can kill you with impunity. Where
does your freedom come in the matter? What freedom
is there in not being allowed to read a foreign newspaper
unless it is expurgated, or in being sent to Siberia
for disapproving of the methods of Government
officials?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The people who were sent to Siberia,” said the landlord,
“were those who wished to overturn the existing
form of government, under which the ordinary individual
enjoyed peculiar liberty. And even here how mildly
the Government acted! Really remarkable agitators
like Tolstoi were left alone. The English acted more
drastically, and hounded Byron and Shelley from the
country. But when it is a question of expressing their
convictions they would never throw a bomb; they
cannot go further than throwing a herring at Mr.
Balfour. The fact is that the English are a nation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>of shopkeepers, and they have the shopkeeper’s aversion
from a mess in the shop.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If that means having shopmen,” said the professor,
“such as Chatham, Fox, Burke, Gladstone, Bright, and
Morley, I wish we were also a nation of shopkeepers.
If a nation’s destinies are controlled by men like
Alexeiev and Bezobrassov it does not seem to me
to make it less like a shop, only the shop is managed
on dishonest principles.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The greatest of all English thinkers,” answered the
landlord, “was a dishonest official, Lord Bacon; her
greatest soldier a general who peculated, the Duke
of Marlborough. The man who made England’s
prestige dwindle to its lowest depth was Gladstone.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We cannot reach a lower depth than that to
which the Bureaucracy has brought us,” said the
student.</p>

<p class='c011'>“As a remedy you want liberal demagogues,” said
the landlord. “What we want is not a change of
kind, but of quality; not a Liberal Cabinet and a
Liberal autocrat, but a capable Cabinet and a capable
autocrat; and, therefore, I support the revolutionaries,
in the hope that out of the ruins and ashes of what
they will destroy the phœnix may arise.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And we,” said the student, “can do without
phœnixes, which we regard as a doubtful blessing;
on the other hand, what we want, and what we are
determined to get, are laws, not manifestoes—laws
guaranteeing the elementary rights of liberty and
equality; and these we are determined to attain, even
at the sacrifice of the peculiar liberty, equality, and
fraternity which you say we enjoy; even if the ultimate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>result be that the Emperor ceases to call us <em>Bratzi</em>
(little brothers) and the theatres are closed on Sunday.”</p>

<p class='c011'>To-day I had a long conversation with X, one of
the most enlightened Liberals in the service of the
Russian Government. He said that the action of
the Government in proclaiming the Manifesto of
October 17th could only be compared to the Declaration
of the Rights of Man by the French Revolution before
any constitution was defined. The Manifesto had
proclaimed in Russia principles unknown in that
country, and the fact remained, although it was sometimes
overlooked, that it was the Government and
not a National Assembly which had taken the
momentous step. Whatever circumstances may have
provoked this step, it is none the less true that Count
Witte by taking it retained the control over the
general situation, and still retains it in spite of all
appearances to the contrary. This was a merit not
recognised by his detractors, who are now universal.
Then he went on to say that the source of the trouble
and confusion now was that the Manifesto formed the
programme and the basis of a Constitution; it was
not a Constitution in itself (since it had been conferred
by an Autocrat and could be taken back again); this
fact had been slow in dawning on the people, unused
to abstract political discussion, and most people,
probably the majority, considered the Manifesto to
be equivalent to an established Constitution. The
trouble is, he added, that some of the most intelligent
of the moderate Liberals of the upper classes do not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>know what a Constitution is. If the Manifesto had
been immediately followed by a Constitution, the
questions which at the present time were giving rise
to heated debate would never have been raised. They
would have been settled before they were discussed
by the public. As it was the Manifesto contained
a collection of principles which all parties sought to
interpret and to exploit to their own advantage. The
reactionary party sees in the preservation of the word
“Autocrat” the key of the situation. He added that
though his party was not large, and had lost a great deal
of its influence, none the less it possessed a deep root
in the Conservative element in Russia. Count Witte,
he said, is supposed, and rightly, to interpret the word
“Autocrat” historically, and to substitute for the word
“Limited” that of “Independent” (International).
He then spoke of the Octobrists, the party of the
17th of October. He said that they showed conciliatory
tendencies, which although obviously well meaning in
times of Revolution, made for weakness. They avoid
the question of title and that of the oath of the
sovereign, and declare themselves satisfied with the clear
and precise act guaranteeing the oath on the part of
the successor to the throne; and they remain content
with the Manifesto as far as the actual sovereign is
concerned. The Radical parties take no interest in this
question, the Social Democrats take even less, since
they look to Revolution and to Revolution only for
the ultimate decision of the destiny of their country.
There are two other questions, he continued, which
up to the present have been scarcely mentioned, nor
is there much hope that the Government will have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>the courage to face them unaided. One is that of
the relations among the different nations of which
the Russian Empire is composed, the other is the
Agrarian question. This last question is not a constitutional
or a legislative question. The power of
the autocrat, while it existed, could alone have solved
it. The autocratic power exists no longer now in fact,
although its place has not yet been taken by a definite
new <i><span lang="fr">régime</span></i>. He said that among the mass of conflicting
conjectures and rumours with regard to the
future, two important things were clear: (1) that the
Government was determined to retain in its hands
the power to give a Constitution; (2) that it was
determined to grant a Constitution and to proceed
to the elections. He said it was impossible to say
more at the present; everything depended on the
nature of the future Assembly, and whether it would
be possible for the Moderate elements to exercise
any preponderating influence. Up to now they had
been widely divergent and discordant among themselves.
If their efforts to gain a solid majority were
successful, the greatest danger would be over; if not,
the Revolution was in its infancy, for if the Moderates
were to fail, the two extreme parties would be left face
to face, as different from one another as possible,
yet both at one for different reasons in their uncompromising
opposition to all temperate and constitutional
reform. He said he made no allusion to
the various risings and repressions, because these
events exercised, in reality, only an indirect influence
on the progress of the ideas he had mentioned,
sometimes by facilitating their spread, and sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>by impeding it. It had neither produced nor
stopped them. There were two parallel and different
currents of events now in progress in Russia. One
forced itself on the attention, the other was exceedingly
difficult to trace. For that reason it was futile to
discuss exclusively the progress of revolutionary feeling
and the ultimate success of repressive measures.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is interesting to look back on this conversation
now in December, 1906, since it shows the illusions
which Russian Liberals cherished a year ago.</p>

<p class='c011'>I have put into the form of a dialogue some of the
many conflicting views I have lately heard expressed
with regard to Count Witte.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We have no right,” said the Moderate Liberal, “to
doubt the good faith of the Government at the present
moment as regards the promise of the Constitution and
the elections for the Duma. Until the Government
proves to us that it does not intend to keep its word
we are bound to believe it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It has never kept its word in the past,” said the
student, “and everything which it is doing at present
tends to show that it has no intention of doing so now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Count Witte knows what he is doing,” said the man
of business. “When our grandchildren read of this
in books they will wonder why we were so blind and so
obstinate, just as we now wonder at the blindness which
prevailed when the opposition to Bismarck was
absolutely universal.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I share the scepticism of our young friend,” said the
Zemstvo representative, “but for different reasons. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>do not share your confidence in Count Witte. The
basis of that confidence is in your case the fact that
Count Witte is a man of business. I maintain that a
man of business can only exert a real and lasting
influence in the affairs of a nation in times of revolution,
convulsion, and evolution, or what you please to
call it, on one condition, namely, that of recognising and
taking into account the force of ideas and of moral laws.
You smile, and say that this is nonsense. But I say
this, not because I am an idealist, for I am not one, but
because I have got an open mind, which seeks the
causes of certain phenomena and finds them in the
existence of certain facts. One of these facts is this:
that you cannot set at naught certain moral laws; you
cannot trample on certain ideas without their rebounding
on to you with invincible force. You men of
business deny the existence of these moral laws, and
scoff at the force of ideas; but it is on practice and facts
that I base my argument, and not on theory. That is
why men like Cromwell succeed, and why men like
Metternich fail.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And Napoleon?” asked the man of business.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Napoleon slighted one of these laws by invading
Spain, and this was the cause of his overthrow, although
Napoleon was a soldier, which is an incalculable advantage.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And Bismarck?” asked the man of business.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bismarck,” said the Zemstvo representative, “is a
case in point. He followed and used ideas. He worked
for the great national ideal, the ideal of united Germany.
He incarnated the national idea. What is Count Witte’s
ideal? A national loan or the expansion of the Russo-Chinese
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>Bank? It is not enough to say that the revolution
is merely the work of enemies financed by
foreigners, and then <i><span lang="de">Schwamm darüber</span></i>, as the Germans
say. Whoever supports it, it is there; and if it were
merely an artificial forced product, surely you, as a man
of business, must admit that it would have died a natural
death by this time. You say that the people can only be
actuated by their own interests. I say that the people
are often actuated by something which has nothing to
do with their interests. History affords me countless
examples which prove I am right. When people
have been killed, tortured, and burnt for an idea, it is
absurd to say they were interested. Interested in what?
In the possible rewards of a future life? But people
have been tortured and burnt not only for their faith
but for their opinions: Giordano Bruno, De Witt, and
many others. There are some, too, whose outward
enthusiasm has been lined with scepticism, and who
have died for a cause in which they did not even believe.
And when a person now throws a bomb at a governor
it may explain the fact to say he is mad, but it does not
explain the fact to say that he is bought, because he
knows quite well he is going to certain death. To deny
this is a sign, in my opinion, of a limited intelligence.
‘<span lang="fr">Il n’a pas l’intelligence assez large,’ a French writer
once said, ‘pour concevoir que l’intérêt n’est pas seul à
mener le monde, qu’il se mêle souvent et qu’il cède
parfois à des passions plus fortes, voire à des passions
nobles.</span>’ This is why I disbelieve in Count Witte. I
believe he suffers from this limitation, the limitation
from which Bismarck did not suffer. In times of peace
it would not signify; in times such as these it makes all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>the difference. Have you read a book by H. G. Wells
called the ‘Food of the Gods’? I do not know what the
English think of Wells; but we, some of us at least, and
the French, take him seriously as a thinker. Well, in
this book there is an argument between a Prime Minister
and the representative of the giant race. All the Prime
Minister’s arguments are excellent, but they are fundamentally
wrong, because his action is morally wrong.
This story applies to the situation here. A race of
giants has grown up. Count Witte, with conviction
and eloquence, repeats again and again that their action
is impossible, that he must be helped, that the existence
of mankind is at stake. But all the time he is denying
to this race the right of existence. And they know
they have the right to live. He is denying the moral
law and saying that his opponents are only hirelings,
or madmen. His arguments are specious, but the
giants are there, and they will not listen; he sends
troops and police against them; they answer by
bombarding the country with their giant food, which
causes gigantic growth to spring up wherever it falls.
In our case this food takes the shape of ideas and the
rights of man.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, but since he has promised a Constitution,” said
the Moderate Liberal, “you cannot prove that he does
not mean to keep his promise.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I feel certain he will give some kind of a Constitution,”
answered the Zemstvo representative. “I feel
equally certain that it will mean nothing at all. I am
not convinced for a moment that he believes in Constitutional
Government for Russia. And if he disbelieves
in it, why should he give it?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>“But what makes you think he disbelieves in it?”
asked the Liberal.</p>

<p class='c011'>“His present action,” remarked the student.</p>

<p class='c011'>“His past actions,” said the Zemstvo representative.
“Why did he not support Prince Mirsky’s reforms?
And apart from this, has he not said in the past, again
and again, that a strong autocracy is the only Government
suitable for Russia?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He is quite right there,” said the man of business.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then you agree with me,” said the Zemstvo representative,
“in thinking that he does not believe in a
Constitution. I think myself that a capable and wise
autocracy may very well be the ideal Government.
But the position now is that the autocracy has for a
long time past shown itself to be neither capable nor
wise, and therefore the enormous majority of thinking
Russians are quite determined to do away with it.
‘Absolute Princes,’ Dr. Johnson said, ‘seldom do any
harm, but those who are governed by them are governed
by chance.’ We are tired of being governed by chance.
We may be unreasonable, but we are determined to try
something else.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We will see,” said the man of business, “assuming
what you say to be true, who is the stronger, you and
your giant food of ideas and moral laws, or Count Witte
and his practical sense. We have the bayonets on our
side.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The bayonets of a defeated army,” said the Zemstvo
representative. “We will see how long you will be able
to sit upon them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not pretend to be a prophet or a philosopher,”
answered the man of business, “but I note certain facts;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>one of these is this, that ever since October I have been
told by your friends that Count Witte’s position is
untenable, and his resignation a question of hours. It has
not come about yet. He still retains the direction of
affairs. Should we meet in five years’ time I will discuss
Count Witte’s policy with you. At present we are
too near to it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And it too far from us,” said the student.</p>

<p class='c011'>Towards the end of this conversation, a man who
belonged to no party came into the room and overheard
the talk. When they had finished talking he said:
“As to Witte, the question seems to me to lie in this:
is he acting consciously and with foresight or is he
merely making the best of chance? We are all praying
for a genius to appear in Russia. But, when geniuses do
come, nobody ever recognises the fact until it is too late
and they are dead. If Witte is acting consciously then
he is a genius indeed. If he has foreseen all along what
would happen, and, in a few years’ time, is President of
the Federation of Russian United States, having decentralised
what he has so capably centralised, then I think
he will be one of the greatest men who have ever
lived; but, if he is merely acting as the occasion
presents itself, I do not rate him higher than a Boulanger
with a head for figures.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In any case,” said the Zemstvo representative, “he
will provide glorious food for discussion for the future
historian, and even at present the world would be a duller
and greyer place without this enigmatical chameleon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>I have frequently heard the opinion expressed that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>the Russian Revolution can inspire nothing but disgust
owing to the fact that it has produced no great men,
and to its lack of big, stirring epic events, in contradistinction
to the French Revolution, which was so rich
in all these things. It is, therefore, interesting to
note what impression the events of the French Revolution
produced on impartial foreign contemporary
opinion.</p>

<p class='c011'>We derive one definite impression of the French
Revolution by reading Carlyle, or Mignet, or Taine;
but the foreign contemporaries who were not themselves
mingled in the tragic events received a very
different and far more fragmentary series of impressions.
Horace Walpole, in his letters, gives us interesting
glimpses into the contemporary opinion of the
period. At the time of the storming of the Bastille he
wrote as follows: “If the Bastille conquers, still is it
impossible, considering the general spirit in the country,
and the numerous fortified places in France, but some
may be seized by the <em>dissidents</em>, and whole provinces
be torn from the Crown? On the other hand, if the
King prevails, what heavy despotism will the <i><span lang="fr">États</span></i>,
by their want of temper and moderation, have drawn
on their country! They might have obtained many
capital points, and removed great oppression. No
French monarch will ever summon <i><span lang="fr">États</span></i> again if
this moment has been thrown away.” It is interesting
to note how doubtful he considers the success of the
revolutionaries to be. Again, he adds in the same
letter: “One hears of no genius on either side, nor do
symptoms of any appear. There will, perhaps; such
times and tempests bring forth, at least bring out,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>great men. I do not take the Duke of Orleans or
Mirabeau to be built “du bois dont on les fait”; no,
nor M. Necker. He may be a great traitor if he made
the confusion designedly; but it is a woful evasion if
the promised financier slips into a black politician.”
A criticism similar to that passed on Necker I have
myself heard applied to Count Witte on several occasions
in St. Petersburg.</p>

<p class='c011'>In July, 1790, he again returns to the charge:
“Franklin and Washington were great men. None
have appeared yet in France, and Necker has only
returned to make a wretched figure.... Why, then,
does he stay?” This is the question which the <cite>Russ</cite>,
the anti-Governmental newspaper, is asking every day
in like terms about Count Witte. In August, 1790, he
says about the French: “They have settled nothing
like a Constitution; on the contrary, they seem to protract
everything but violence as much as they can in
order to keep their louis a day.” This might be
applied not without appositeness to certain of the
Bureaucrats here. In September, 1791, Horace Walpole
is even more pessimistic. He thinks that twenty
thousand men could march from one end of France to
the other. But he apprehends the possibility of enthusiasm
turning to courage against a foreign enemy.
What he disbelieves in is a set of “military noble lads,
pedantic academicians, curates of villages, and country
advocates amidst the utmost confusion and altercation
amongst themselves” composing a system of government
that would set four and twenty millions of people
free. “This, too,” he adds, “without one great man
amongst them. If they had had, as Mirabeau seemed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>to promise to be—but as we know that he was, too,
a consummate villain, there would soon have been
an end of their vision of liberty. And so there will
be still, unless, after a civil war, they split into small
kingdoms or commonwealths. A little nation may be
free.... Millions cannot be so; because, the greater
the number of men that are one people, the more vices,
the more abuses there are, that will either require or
furnish pretexts for restraints.” It is plain from the above
quotations that whatever contemporary foreign writers
thought of the French Revolution there was one thing
which they did not think, and that was that the prominent
actors in it were big men; or that the whole
movement was anything but disgusting and futile.</p>

<p class='c011'>Later, in 1793, Horace Walpole’s horror and disgust,
as was natural, knew no bounds. He thinks, moreover,
that the proceedings of the French Republicans had
wounded the cause of liberty and shaken it for centuries.
Now the popular atmosphere of legend that
has grown up round the Revolution takes as its keynote
a phrase of Victor Hugo’s: “Les hommes de 1793
étaient des géants.” In Russia we have not got so far
as 1793. We are still at the beginning of 1789, and
it is quite possible that the future Carlyle who writes
the history of this period will say the men of 1905 were
giants. The Duma will give opportunities for popular
tribunes, and apart from and in contradistinction to
great orators or tribunes, it may be doubted whether
revolutions, while they are going on, ever produce great
men. The great men come afterwards.</p>

<p class='c011'>But when people point to the seemingly effectual
repression that is now taking place here, and ask how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>it is possible for the Revolution to continue, they forget
that there is a difference—a small but vastly important
difference—between the present state of affairs and the
period of the late M. Plehve’s <i><span lang="fr">régime</span></i>. The difference
consists in the fact that before the general strike and
the October Manifesto, before even the taking of Port
Arthur, Prince Mirsky opened a little window in the
tight-closed room of Russian politics by relaxing the
stringent Press regulations and letting loose public
opinion. The light came in like a flood, and nothing
can now drive it out. Repression when public opinion
was crushed was a very different thing from repression
when every case of it is reported in detail in the newspapers,
as now happens. For people can say what
they like about the unreality or the non-existence of
the liberty of the Press; one has only to buy the
Radical newspapers to be convinced that if the Press
is not free it is certainly more explicit and more unrestrained
in its violence than the Press of any other
European country, and some of the comic satirical
newspapers might have Marat for editor.</p>

<p class='c011'>Somebody once said that he would have given anything
in the world to have half an hour’s private interview
with the late Lord Beaconsfield with a pistol, and
to obtain from him under the threat of death an exact
and complete account of his views and convictions.
It would be interesting to perform a similar experiment
on Count Witte; whatever the result of it might be,
I doubt if there would be found a trace of the placid
optimism which is sometimes attributed to him. Count
Witte may be attacked for many things; he cannot
be accused of a lack of clear-sightedness: not, that is,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>if he be judged by the utterances which he is known
to have made before the outbreak of the war, or by
those which he made publicly before entering office,
and while the war was still going on. Mirabeau
was, in the opinion of Horace Walpole, a ruffian; he
was certainly distrusted by both parties, but we know
now, though the fact escaped the notice of his contemporaries,
that he gauged the forces at work and the
probable trend of events with surprising accuracy. We
now consider Mirabeau to have been something like
a great man. Count Witte has perhaps inspired among
all parties a greater distrust than that which was the
lot of Mirabeau; but in times such as these clear-sightedness,
self-confidence, and capacity for hard
work are precious qualities indeed. Nobody denies
the possession of these qualities to Count Witte. It
is not, therefore, impossible that the future historian
may place him in the same niche as Mirabeau in the
Pantheon of the world. This, as Horace Walpole says,
is speculation, not prophecy. And I revert, or rather
arrive, at these conclusions, that a lull in events does
not necessarily imply their final cessation; that so far
in Russia revolutionary matters have succeeded one
another, if anything, with greater rapidity than they
did in France, and that what seems to be the unmistakable
dawn of revolution to the historian may very
well appear to be a false dawn to the contemporary
observer; and that, whatever happens, nothing can ever
shut the little window which Prince Mirsky opened.</p>

      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>St. Petersburg</span>, <em>February 24th</em>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>They are celebrating the 25th anniversary of
the death of Dostoievski, and this fact has
brought back to my mind, with great vividness, a conversation
I had with the officers of the battery at
Jen-tzen-tung last September, and which I have already
noted in my diary.</p>

<p class='c011'>We were sitting in the ante-room of the small
Chinese house which formed our quarters. This ante-room,
which had paper windows and no doors, a floor
of mud, and a table composed of boards laid upon two
small tressels, formed our dining-room. We had just
finished dinner, and were drinking tea out of pewter
cups. Across the courtyard from the part of the
dwelling where the Chinese herded together, we could
hear the monotonous song of a Chinaman or a Mongol
singing over and over to himself the same strophe,
which rose by the intervals of a scale more subtle
than ours and sank again to die away in the vibrations
of one prolonged note, to the accompaniment of a
single-stringed instrument.</p>

<p class='c011'>The conversation had languished. Somebody was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>absorbed in a patience, we were talking of books and
novels in a vague, desultory fashion, when suddenly
Hliebnikov, a young Cossack officer, said: “Who is
the greatest writer in the world?” Vague answers
were made as to the comparative merits of Homer,
Dante, Shakespeare, and Molière, but Hliebnikov
impatiently waived all this talk aside. Then turning
to me he said: “He knows; there is one writer greater
than all of them, and that is Dostoievski.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dostoievski!” said the doctor. “Dostoievski’s
work is like a clinical laboratory or a dissecting-room.
There is no sore spot in the human soul into which he
does not poke his dirty finger. His characters are either
mad or abnormal. His books are those of a madman,
and can only be appreciated by people who are half
mad themselves.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The young Cossack officer did not bother to discuss
the question. He went out into the night in disgust.
We continued the argument for a short time. “There
is not a single character,” said the doctor, “in all
Dostoievski’s books who is normal.” The doctor was
a cultivated man, and seeing that we differed we agreed
to differ, and we talked of other things, but I was left
wondering why Hliebnikov was so convinced that
Dostoievski was the greatest of all writers, and why
he knew I should agree with him. I have been thinking
this over ever since, and in a sense I do agree
with Hliebnikov. I think that Dostoievski is the
greatest writer that has ever lived, if by a great writer
is meant a man whose work, message, or whatever you
like to call it, can do the greatest good, can afford the
greatest consolation to poor humanity. If we mean
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>by the greatest writer the greatest artist, the most
powerful magician, who can bid us soar like Shelley
or Schubert into the seventh heaven of melody, or
submerge us like Wagner beneath heavy seas until
we drown with pleasure, or touch and set all the fibres
of our associations and our æsthetic appreciation
vibrating with incommunicable rapture by the magic
of wonderful phrases like Virgil or Keats, or strike into
our very heart with a divine sword like Sappho, Catullus,
Heine, or Burns, or ravish us by the blend of pathos
and nobility of purpose with faultless diction like Leopardi,
Gray, and Racine, or bid us understand and
feel the whole burden of mankind in a thin thread
of notes like Beethoven or in a few simple words like
Goethe, or evoke for us the whole pageant of life like
Shakespeare to the sound of Renaissance flutes, or
all Heaven and Hell like Dante, by “thoughts that
breathe and words that burn”?</p>

<p class='c011'>If we are thinking of all these miraculous achievements
when we say a great writer or the greatest
writer, then we must not name Dostoievski. Dostoievski
is not of these; in his own province, that of the
novelist, he is as a mere workman, a mere craftsman,
one of the worst, inferior to any French or English
ephemeral writer of the day you like to mention; but,
on the other hand, if we mean by a great writer a man
who has given to mankind an inestimable boon, a
priceless gift, a consolation, a help to life, which nothing
can equal or replace, then Dostoievski is a great writer,
and perhaps the greatest writer that has ever lived. I
mean that if the Holy Scriptures were destroyed and
no trace were left of them in the world, the books
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>where mankind, bereft of its Divine and inestimable
treasure, would find the nearest approach to the
supreme message of comfort would be the books of
Dostoievski.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dostoievski is not an artist; his stories and his books
are put together and shaped anyhow. The surroundings
and the circumstances in which he places his
characters are fantastic and impossible to the verge of
absurdity. The characters themselves are also often
impossible and fantastic to the verge of absurdity;
yet they are vivid in a way no other characters are
vivid, and alive, not only so that we perceive and
recognise their outward appearance, but so that we
know the innermost corners of their souls. His
characters, it is said, are abnormal. One of his principal
figures is a murderer who kills an old woman from
ambition to be like Napoleon, and put himself above
the law; another is a victim to epileptic fits. But the
fact should be borne in mind that absolutely normal
people, like absolutely happy nations, have no history;
that since the whole of humanity is suffering and
groaning beneath the same burden of life, the people
who in literature are the most important to mankind
are not the most normal, but those who are made
of the most complex machinery and of the most
receptive wax, and who are thus able to receive and
to record the deepest and most varied impressions.
And in the same way as Job and David are more
important to humanity than George I. or Louis-Philippe,
so are Hamlet and Falstaff more important
than Tom Jones and Mr. Bultitude. And the reason
of this is not because Hamlet and Falstaff are abnormal—although
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>compared with Tom Jones they are
abnormal—but because they are human: more profoundly
human, and more widely human. Hamlet
has been read, played, and understood by succeeding
generations in various countries and tongues, in
innumerable different and contradictory fashions; but
in each country, at each period, and in each tongue, he
has been understood by his readers or his audience,
according to their lights, because in him they have seen
a reflection of themselves, because in themselves they
have found an echo of Hamlet. The fact that audiences,
actors, readers, and commentators have all interpreted
Hamlet in utterly contradictory ways testifies not
merely to the profound humanity of the character
but to its multiplicity and manysidedness. Every
human being recognises in himself something of Hamlet
and something of Falstaff; but every human being
does not necessarily recognise in himself something
of Tom Jones or Mr. Bultitude. At least what in these
characters resembles him is so like himself that he
cannot notice the likeness; it consists in the broad
elementary facts of being a human being; but when
he hears Hamlet or Falstaff philosophising or making
jokes on the riddle of life he is suddenly made conscious
that he has gone through the same process himself in
the same way.</p>

<p class='c011'>So it is with Dostoievski. Dostoievski’s characters
are mostly abnormal, but it is in their very abnormality
that we recognise their profound and poignant humanity
and a thousand human traits that we ourselves share.
And in showing us humanity at its acutest, at its
intensest pitch of suffering, at the soul’s lowest depth of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>degradation, or highest summit of aspiration, he makes
us feel his comprehension, pity, and love for everything
that is in us, so that we feel that there is nothing
which we could think or experience; no sensation, no
hope, no ambition, no despair, no disappointment, no
regret, no greatness, no meanness that he would not
understand; no wound, no sore for which he would not
have just the very balm and medicine which we need.
Pity and love are the chief elements of the work of
Dostoievski—pity such as King Lear felt on the
heath; and just as the terrible circumstances in
which King Lear raves and wanders make his pity
all the greater and the more poignant in its pathos,
so do the fantastic, nightmarish circumstances in
which Dostoievski’s characters live make their humanness
more poignant, their love more lovable, their pity
more piteous.</p>

<p class='c011'>A great writer should see “life steadily and see life
whole.” Dostoievski does not see the whole of life
steadily, like Tolstoi, for instance, but he sees the soul
of man whole, and perhaps he sees more deeply into
it than any other writer has done. He shrinks from
nothing. He sees the “soul of goodness in things
evil”: not exclusively the evil, like Zola; nor does he
evade the evil like many of our writers. He sees and
pities it. And this is why his work is great. He
writes about the saddest things that can happen; the
most melancholy, the most hopeless, the most terrible
things in the world; but his books do not leave us with
a feeling of despair; on the contrary, his own “sweet
reasonableness,” the pity and love with which they are
filled are like balm. We are left with a belief in some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>great inscrutable goodness, and his books act upon us
as once his conversation did on a fellow prisoner whom
he met on the way to Siberia. The man was on the
verge of suicide; but after Dostoievski had talked to
him for an hour—we may be sure there was no
sermonising in that talk—he felt able to go on, to live
even with perpetual penal servitude before him. To
some people, Dostoievski’s books act in just this way,
and it is, therefore, not odd that they think him the
greatest of all writers.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>The political parties which are now crystallising
themselves are the result of the Liberal movement
which began in the twenties, and proceeded steadily
until the beginning of the war in 1904, when the Liberal
leaders resolved, for patriotic reasons, to mark time and
wait. This cessation of hostilities did not last long, and
the disasters caused by the war produced so universal a
feeling of discontent that the liberation movement was
automatically set in motion once more.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the 19th of June, 1905, a deputation of the
United Zemstva, at the head of which was Prince
S. N. Troubetzkoi, was received by the Emperor.
Prince Troubetzkoi, in a historic speech, expressed
with the utmost frankness and directness the imperative
need of sweeping reform and of the introduction
of national representation. The coalition of the Zemstva
formed the first political Russian party, but it was not
until after the great strike, and the granting of the
Manifesto in October, that parties of different shades
came into existence and took definite shape. During
the month which followed the Manifesto the process of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>crystallisation of parties began, and is still continuing,
and they can now roughly be divided into three categories—Right,
Centre, and Left, the Right being the
extreme Conservatives, the Centre the Constitutional
Monarchists, and the Left consisting of two wings, the
Constitutional Democrats on the right and the Social
Democrats and Social Revolutionaries on the left. Of
these the most important is the party of the Constitutional
Democrats, nicknamed the “Cadets.” “Cadets”
means “K.D.,” the word “Constitutional” being spelt
with a “K” in Russian, and as the letter “K” in the
Russian alphabet has the same sound as it has in
French, the result is a word which sounds exactly
like the French word “Cadet.” Similarly, Social
Revolutionaries are nicknamed “S.R.’s” and the Social
Democrats “S.D.’s.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In order to understand the origin of the Constitutional
Democrats one must understand the part played by the
Zemstva. In 1876 a group of County Councillors, or
Zemstvoists, under the leadership of M. Petrunkevitch
devoted themselves to the task of introducing reforms
in the economical condition of Russia. In 1894 their
representatives, headed by M. Rodichev, were summarily
sent about their business, after putting forward
a few moderate demands. In 1902 these men formed
with others a “League of Liberation.” M. Schipov
tried to unite these various “Zemstva” in a common
organisation, and some of the members of the Liberation
League, while co-operating with them, started a
separate organisation called the Zemstvo Constitutionalists.
Among the members of this group were
names which are well known in Russia, such as Prince
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>Dolgoroukov, MM. Stachovitch, Kokoshkin, and
Lvov. But these “Zemstvoists” formed only a small
group; what they needed, in order to represent thinking
Russia, was to be united with the professional classes.
In November, 1904, the various professions began to
group themselves together in political bodies. Various
political unions were formed, such as those of the
engineers, doctors, lawyers, and schoolmasters. Then
Professor Milioukov, one of the leading pioneers of the
Liberal movement, whose name is well known in Europe
and America, united all professional unions into a great
“Union of Unions,” which represented the great mass
of educated Russia. Before the great strike in October,
1905, he created, together with the best of his colleagues,
a new political party, which united the mass of professional
opinion with the small group of Zemstvo leaders.
He had recognised the fact that the Zemstvoists were
the only men who had any political experience, and
that they could do nothing without enrolling the professional
class. Therefore it is owing to Professor
Milioukov that the experienced Zemstvo leaders in
October had the whole rank and file of the middle
class behind them, and the Constitutional Democrats,
as they are at present, represent practically the whole
“Intelligenzia,” or professional class, of Russia. This
party is the only one which is seriously and practically
organised. This being so, it is the most important of
the political parties.</p>

<p class='c011'>Those of the Right have not enough followers to give
them importance, and those of the Left have announced
their intention of boycotting the elections. These
various parties are now preparing for the elections.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>We are experiencing now the suspense of an <i><span lang="fr">entr’acte</span></i>
before the curtain rises once more on the next act of
the revolutionary drama. This will probably occur
when the Duma meets in April. People of all parties
seem to be agreed as to one thing, that the present
state of things cannot last. There is at present a
reaction against reaction. After the disorders here in
December many people were driven to the Right; now
the reactionary conduct of the Government has driven
them back to the Left.</p>

<p class='c011'>So many people have been arrested lately that there
is no longer room for them in prison. An influential
political leader said to me yesterday that a proof of the
incompetence of the police was that they had not foreseen
the armed rising in December, whereas every one
else had foreseen it. “And now,” he said, “they have
been, so to speak, let loose on the paths of repression;
old papers and old cases, sometimes of forty years ago,
are raked up, and people are arrested for no reason
except that the old machine, which is broken and
thoroughly out of order, has been set working with
renewed energy.” The following conversation is related
to me—if it is not true (and I am convinced that it is
not true) it is typical—as having taken place between a
Minister and his subordinate:—</p>

<p class='c011'>The Subordinate: There are so many people in
prison that there is no possibility of getting in another
man. The prisons are packed, yet arrests are still
being made. What are we to do? Where are these
people to be put?</p>

<p class='c011'>The Minister: We must let some of the prisoners out.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Subordinate: How many?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>The Minister: Say five thousand.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Subordinate: Why five thousand?</p>

<p class='c011'>The Minister: A nice even number.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Subordinate: But how? Which? How shall
we choose them?</p>

<p class='c011'>The Minister: Let out any five thousand. What
does it matter to them? Any five thousand will be
as pleased as any other to be let out.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is interesting to note that last November the
Minister of the Interior was reported to have said that
if he could be given a free hand to arrest twenty
thousand “intellectuals,” he would stop the revolution.
The twenty thousand have been arrested, but
the revolution has not been stopped.</p>

<p class='c011'>So far, in spite of the many manifestoes, no guarantee
of a Constitution has been granted. The Emperor has,
it is true, declared that he will fulfil the promises made
in his declaration of the 17th of October, and it is true
that if these promises were fulfilled, the result would be
Constitutional Government. But at the same time he
declared that his absolute power remained intact. At
first sight this appears to be a contradiction in terms;
but, as the Power which granted the Manifesto of
October 17th was autocratic and unlimited, and as it
made no mention of the future limiting of itself, it is
now, as a matter of fact, not proceeding contrarily
to any of its promises. The liberties which were
promised may only have been meant to be temporary.
They could be withdrawn at any moment, since the
Emperor’s autocratic power remained. The Manifesto
might only have been a sign of goodwill of the Emperor
towards his people. It promised certain things, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>gave no guarantee as to the fulfilment of these promises.
The whole of Russia, it is true, understood it otherwise.
The whole of Russia understood when this Manifesto
was published that a Constitution had been promised,
and that autocracy was in future to be limited. What
Count Witte understood by it, it is difficult to say.
Whether he foresaw or not that this Manifesto by its
vagueness would one day mean much less than it did
then, or whether he only realised this at the same time
that he realised that the Conservative element was
much stronger than it was thought to be, it is impossible
to determine. The fact remains that the Emperor has
not withdrawn anything; he has merely not done what
he never said he would do, namely, voluntarily abdicate
his autocratic power.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Conservatives are opposed to any such proceeding;
not in the same way as the extreme reactionaries,
some of whom relegated the portrait of
the Emperor to the scullery on the day of the Manifesto
from sheer Conservative principle, but because they
say that if the autocratic power is destroyed the peasant
population will be convulsed, and the danger will be
immense. To this Liberals—all liberal-minded men,
not revolutionaries—reply that this supposed danger
is a delusion of the Conservatives, who have unconsciously
invented the fact to support their theory and
have not based their theory on the fact; that many
peasants clearly understand and recognise that there
is to be a constitutional <i><span lang="fr">régime</span></i> in Russia; that if this
danger does exist, the risk incurred by it must be
taken; that in any case it is the lesser of two evils,
less dangerous than the maintenance of the autocracy.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>Count Witte’s opponents on the Liberal side say that
the course of events up to this moment has been
deliberately brought about by Count Witte; that he
disbelieved and disbelieves in Constitutional Government
for Russia; that he provoked disorder in order
to crush the revolutionary element; that the Moderate
parties played into his hands by not meeting him with
a united front; that, Duma or no Duma, he intends
everything to remain as before and the power to be
in his hands. What his supporters say I do not know,
because I have never seen one in the flesh, but I have
seen many people who say that what has happened
so far has been brought about with infinite skill and
knowledge of the elements with which he had to deal.
Further, they add that Count Witte has no principles
and no convictions; that he has always accommodated
himself to the situation of the moment, and worked
in harmony with the men of the moment, whatever
they were; that he has no belief in the force or the
stability of any movement in Russia; that he trusts
the Russian character to simmer down after it has
violently fizzed; that he intends to outstay the fizzing
period; that he has a great advantage in the attitude
of the Moderate parties, who, although they do not
trust him, play into his hands by disagreeing on small
points and not meeting him with clear and definite
opposition. They add, however, that he has miscalculated
and wrongly gauged the situation this time,
because the simmering down period will only be
temporary and the fizzing will be renewed again with
increasing violence, until either the cork flies into space
or the bottle is burst. The cork is autocracy, the bottle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>Russia, and the mineral water the revolution. The
corkscrew was the promise of a Constitution with
which the cork was partially loosened, only to be
screwed down again by Count Witte’s powerful hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>Among all the parties the most logical seem to be
the Extreme Conservatives and the Extreme Radicals.
The Extreme Conservatives have said all along that
the talk of a Constitution was nonsensical, and the
Manifesto of October 17th a great betrayal; that the
only result of it has been disorder, riot, and bloodshed.
They are firmly based on a principle. The Extreme
Radicals are equally firmly based on a principle,
namely, that the autocratic <i><span lang="fr">régime</span></i> must be done away
with at all costs, and that until it is swept away and a
Constitution based on universal suffrage takes its place
there is no hope for Russia. Therefore the danger
that the Moderate parties may eventually be submerged
and the two extremes be left face to face,
still exists. As a great quantity of the Radicals are
in prison they are for the time being less perceptible;
but this era of repression cannot last, and it has already
created a reaction against itself. But then the question
arises, what will happen when it stops? What will
happen when the valve on which the police have been
sitting is released?</p>

<p class='c011'>The influential political leader with whom I dined
last night, and who is one of the leading members of the
party of October 17th, said that there was not a man
in Russia who believed in Witte, that Witte was
a man who had no convictions. I asked why he
himself and other Zemstvo leaders had refused to take
part in the administration directly after the Manifesto
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>had been issued, when posts in the Cabinet were
offered to them. He said their terms had been that the
Cabinet should be exclusively formed of Liberal leaders;
but they did not choose to serve in company with a
man like Durnovo, with whom he would refuse to
shake hands.</p>

<p class='c011'>He added that it would not have bettered their
position in the country with regard to the coming
Duma, which he was convinced would be Liberal.
Talking of the Constitutional Democrats he said they

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>When one has seen a thing which had hitherto
been vaguely familiar suddenly illuminated
by a flood of light, making it real, living, and vivid, it
is difficult to recall one’s old state of mind before the
inrush of the illuminating flood; and still more difficult
to discuss that thing with people who have not had
the opportunity of illumination. The experience is
similar to that which a child feels when, after having
worshipped a certain writer of novels or tales, and
wondered why he was not acknowledged by the whole
world to be the greatest author that has ever been,
he grows up, and by reading other books, sees the
old favourite in a new light, the light of fresh
horizons opened by great masterpieces; in this new
light the old favourite seems to be a sorry enough
impostor, his golden glamour has faded to tinsel. The
grown-up child will now with difficulty try to discover
what was the cause and secret of his old infatuation,
and every now and then he will receive a shock on
hearing some fellow grown-up person talk of the former
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>idol in the same terms as he would have talked
of him when a child, the reason being that this
second person has never got farther; has never
reached the illuminating light of new horizons. So
it is with many things; and so it is in my case with
Russia. I find it extremely difficult to recall exactly
what I thought Russia was before I had been there;
and I find Russia difficult to describe to those who
have never been there. There is so much when one has
been there that becomes so soon a matter of course
that it no longer strikes one, but which to the newcomer
is probably striking.</p>

<p class='c011'>The first time I came to Russia I travelled straight
to the small village where I am now staying. What
did I imagine Russia to be like? All I can think
of now is that there was a big blank in my mind. I
had read translations of Russian books, but they had
left no definite picture or landscape in my mind; I had
read some books about Russia and got from them very
definite pictures of a fantastic country, which proved
to be curiously unlike Russia in every respect. A
country where feudal castles, Pevenseys and Hurstmonceuxs,
loomed in a kind of Rhine-land
covered with snow, inhabited by mute, inglorious
Bismarcks, and Princesses who carried about dynamite
in their cigarette-cases and wore bombs in their
tiaras; Princesses who owed much of their being to
Ouida, and some of it to Sardou.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then everything in these books was so gloriously
managed; everybody was so efficient, so powerful;
the Bismarcks so Machiavellian and so mighty; the
Princesses so <i><span lang="la">splendide mendaces</span></i>. The background was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>also gorgeous, barbaric, crowded with Tartars and
Circassians, blazing with scimitars, pennons, armour,
and sequins, like a scene in a Drury Lane pantomime;
and every now and then a fugitive household
would gallop in the snow through a primæval forest,
throwing their children to the wolves, so as to escape
being devoured themselves. This, I think, was the
impression of Russia which I derived before I went
there from reading French and English fiction about
Russia, from Jules Verne’s “Michel Strogoff,” and
from memories of many melodramas. Then came
the impressions received from reading Russian books,
which were again totally different from this melodramatic
atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c011'>From Russian novels I derived a clear idea of
certain types of men who drank tea out of a
samovar and drove forty versts in a vehicle called a
<em>Tarantass</em>. I made the acquaintance of all kinds of
people, who were as real to me as living acquaintances;
of Natascha and Levine, and Pierre and
Anna Karenine, and Basaroff, and Dolly, and many
others. But I never saw their setting clearly, I never
realised their background, and I used to see them move
before a French or German background. Then I saw
the real thing, and it was utterly and totally different
from my imaginations and my expectations. But now
when I try to give the slightest sketch of what the
country is really like the old difficulty presents itself;
the difficulty which arises from talking of a thing
of which one has a clear idea to people who have a
vague and probably false idea of the reality. The
first thing one can safely say is this: eliminate all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>notions of castles, Rhine country, feudal keeps,
and stone houses in general. Think of an endless
plain, a sheet of dazzling snow in winter, an ocean of
golden corn in summer, a tract of brown earth in
autumn, and now in the earliest days of spring an
expanse of white melting snow, with great patches of
brown earth and sometimes green grass appearing at
intervals, and further patches of half-melted snow of
a steely-grey colour, sometimes blue as they
catch the reflection of the dazzling sky in the sunlight.
In the distance on one side the plain stretches
to infinity, on the other you may see the delicate
shapes of a brown, leafless wood, the outlines soft in
the haze. If I had to describe Russia in three words
I should say a plain, a windmill, and a church. The
church is made of wood, and is built in Byzantine
style, with a small cupola and a minaret. It is painted
red and white, or white and pale-green. Sometimes
the cupola is gilt.</p>

<p class='c011'>The plain is dotted with villages, and one village is
very like another. They consist generally of two rows
of houses, forming what does duty for a street, but the
word street would be as misleading as possible in this
case. It would be more exact to say an exceedingly
broad expanse of earth: dusty in summer, and in spring
and autumn a swamp of deep soaking black mud. The
houses, at irregular intervals, sometimes huddled close
together, sometimes with wide gaps between them,
succeed each other (the gaps probably caused by the
fact that the houses which were there have been burnt).
They are made of logs, thatched with straw; sometimes
(but rarely) they are made of bricks and roofed with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>iron. As a rule they look as if they had been built
by Robinson Crusoe. The road is strewn with
straw and rich in abundance of every kind of mess.
Every now and then there is a well of the primitive
kind which we see on the banks of the Nile, and which
one imagines to be of the same pattern as those from
which the people in the Old Testament drew their
water. The roads are generally peopled with peasants
driving at a leisurely walk in winter in big wooden
sledges and in summer in big wooden carts. Often the
cart is going on by itself with somebody in the extreme
distance every now and then grunting at the horse. A
plain, a village, a church, every now and then a wood of
birch-trees, every now and then a stream, a weir, and
a broken-down lock. A great deal of dirt, a great deal
of moisture. An overwhelming feeling of space and
leisureliness, a sense that nothing you could say or do
could possibly hurry anybody or anything, or make
the lazy, creaking wheels of life go faster—that is, I
think, the picture which arises first in my mind when
I think of the Russian country.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then as to the people. With regard to these, there
is one fact of capital importance which must be borne in
mind. The people if you know the language and if you
don’t are two separate things. The first time I went to
Russia I did not know a word of the language, and,
though certain facts were obvious with regard to the
people, I found it a vastly different thing when I could
talk to them myself. So different that I am persuaded
that those who wish to study this country and do not
know the language are wasting their time, and might
with greater profit study the suburbs of London or the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>Isle of Man. And here again a fresh difficulty arises.
All the amusing things one hears said in this country,
all that is characteristic and smells of the Russian land,
all that is peculiarly Russian, is like everything which is
peculiarly anything, peculiarly English, Irish, Italian, or
Turkish, untranslatable, and loses all its savour and
point in translation. This is especially true with regard
to the Russian language, which is rich in peculiar
phrases and locutions, diminutives, and terms which
range over a whole scale of delicate shades of endearment
and familiarity, such as “little pigeon,” “little
father,” &#38;c., and these phrases translated into any other
language lose all their meaning. However, the main
impression I received when I first came to Russia, and
the impression which I received from the Russian
soldiers with whom I mingled in Manchuria in the war,
the impression which is now the strongest with regard
to them is that of <em>humaneness</em>. Those who read in the
newspapers of acts of brutality and ferocity, of houses
set on fire and pillaged, of huge massacres of Jews,
of ruthless executions and arbitrary imprisonments,
will rub their eyes perhaps and think that I must
be insane. It is true, nevertheless. A country which
is in a state of revolution is no more in its normal
condition than a man when he is intoxicated.
If a man is soaked in alcohol and then murders his
wife and children and sets his house on fire, it does not
necessarily prove that he is not a humane member of
society. He may be as gentle as a dormouse and as
timid as a hare by nature. His excitement and demented
behaviour are merely artificial. It seems to me
now that the whole of Russia at this moment is like an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>intoxicated man; a man inebriated after starvation,
and passing from fits of frenzy to sullen stupor. The
truth of this has been illustrated by things which
have lately occurred in the country. Peasants who
have looted the spirit stores and destroyed every house
within reach have repented with tears on the next
day.</p>

<p class='c011'>The peasants have an infinite capacity for pity and
remorse, and therefore the more violent their outbreaks
of fury the more bitter is their remorse. A peasant has
been known to worry himself almost to death, as if he
had committed a terrible crime, because he had smoked
a cigarette before receiving the Blessed Sacrament. If
they can feel acute remorse for such things, much more
acute will it be if they set houses on fire or commit
similar outrages. If you talk to a peasant for two
minutes you will notice that he has a fervent belief in a
great, good, and inscrutable Providence. He never
accuses man of the calamities to which flesh is heir.
When the railway strike was at its height, and we were
held up at a small side station, the train attendant
repeated all day long that God had sent us a severe
trial, which He had. Yesterday I had a talk with a man
who had returned from the war; he had been a soldier
and a surgeon’s assistant, and had received the Cross
of St. George for rescuing a wounded officer under
fire. I asked him if he had been wounded. He said,
“No, my clothes were not even touched; men all around
me were wounded. This was the ordinance of God.
God had pity on the orphan’s tears. It was all prearranged
thus that I was to come home. So it was to
be.” I also had tea with a stonemason yesterday who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>said to me, “I and my whole family have prayed for
you in your absence because these are times of trouble,
and we did not know what bitter cup you might not
have to drink.” Then he gave me three new-laid eggs
with which to eat his very good health.</p>

<p class='c011'>To-day I went out riding through the leafless woods
and I saw one of the most beautiful sights I have ever
seen, a sight peculiarly characteristic of Russian landscape.
We passed a small river that up to now has
been frozen, but the thaw has come and with it the
floods of spring. The whole valley as seen from the
higher slopes of the woods was a sheet of shining water.
Beyond it in the distance was a line of dark-brown
woods. The water was grey, with gleaming layers in it
reflecting the white clouds and the blue sky; and on it
the bare trees seemed to float and rise like delicate
ghosts, casting clearly defined brown reflections. The
whole place had a look of magic and enchantment about
it, as if out of the elements of the winter, out of the
snow and the ice and the leafless boughs, the spring
had devised and evoked a silvery pageant to celebrate
its resurrection.</p>

<p class='c011'>I have spent twelve instructive days in the country;
instructive, because I was able to obtain some first-hand
glimpses into the state of the country, into the
actual frame of mind of the peasants; and the peasants
are the obscure and hidden factor which will ultimately
decide the fate of Russian political life. It is difficult to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>get at the peasants; it is exceedingly difficult to get
them to speak their mind. You can do so by travelling
with them in a third-class carriage, because then they
seem to regard one as a fleeting shadow of no significance
which will soon vanish into space. However,
I saw peasants; I heard them discuss the land question
and the manner in which they proposed to buy their
landlords’ property. I also had some interesting talks
with a man who had lived among the peasants for
years. From him and from others I gathered that
their attitude at present was chiefly one of expectation.
They are waiting to see how things turn out. They
were continually asking my chief informant whether
anything would come of the “levelling” (<em>Ravnienie</em>);
this is, it appears, what they call the revolutionary
movement. It is extremely significant that they look
upon this as a process of equalisation. The land
question in Russia is hopelessly complicated; it is
about ten times as complicated as the land question
in Ireland, and of the same nature. I had glimpses
of this complexity. The village where I was staying
was divided into four “societies”; each of these
societies was willing to purchase so much land, but
when the matter was definitely settled with regard
to one society two representatives of two-thirds of
that society appeared and stated that they were
“Old Souls” (<em>i.e.</em>, they had since the abolition of
serfage a separate arrangement), and wished to purchase
the lands separately in order to avoid its partition;
upon which the representatives of the whole society
said that this was impossible, and that they were the
majority. The “Old Souls” retorted finally that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>a general meeting should be held, and then it would
be seen that the majority was in favour of them.
They were in a minority; and in spite of the speciousness
of their arguments it was difficult to see how the
majority, whose interests were contrary to those of the
“Old Souls,” could be persuaded to support them.
This is only one instance out of many.</p>

<p class='c011'>Another element of complication is that the peasants
who can earn their living by working on the
landlords’ land are naturally greatly averse from anything
like a complete sale of it, and are alarmed by
the possibility of such an idea. Also there is a class
of peasants who work in factories, and therefore are
only interested in the land inasmuch as profit can
be derived from it while it belongs to the landlord.
Again, there are others who are without land, who
need land, and who are too poor to buy it. If all
the land were given to them as a present to-morrow
the result in the long run would be deplorable, because
the quality of the land—once you eliminate
the landlord and his more advanced methods—would
gradually deteriorate and poverty would merely be
spread over a larger area. One fact is obvious: that
many of the peasants have not got enough land, and
to them land is now being sold by a great number
of landlords. To settle the matter further, a radical
scheme of agrarian reform is necessary; many such
schemes are being elaborated at this moment, but those
which have seen the light up to the present have
so far proved a source of universal disagreement. The
fact which lies at the root of the matter is of course
that if the land question is to be solved the peasant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>must be educated to adopt fresher methods of agriculture
than those which were employed in the Garden
of Eden; methods which were doubtless excellent
until the fall of man rendered the cultivation of the
soil a matter of painful duty, instead of pleasant
recreation.</p>

<p class='c011'>I asked my friend who had lived among the peasants
and studied them for years what they thought of things
in general. He said that in this village they had
never been inclined to loot (looting can always arise
from the gathering together of six drunken men), that
they are perfectly conscious of what is happening
(my friend is one of the most impartial and fair-minded
men alive); they are distrustful and they say little;
but they <em>know</em>. As we were talking of these things
I mentioned the fact that a statement I had made
in print about the peasants in this village and in
Russia generally reading Milton’s “Paradise Lost”
had been received with interest in England and in
some quarters with incredulity. It was in this very
village and from the same friend, who had been a
teacher there for more than twenty years, that I first
heard of this. It was afterwards confirmed by my own
experience.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who denies it?” he asked. “Russians or Englishmen?”
“Englishmen,” I answered. “But why?” he
said. “I have only read it myself once long ago,
but I should have thought that it was obvious that
such a work would be likely to make a strong
impression.”</p>

<p class='c011'>I explained that at first sight it appeared to Englishmen
incredible that Russian peasants, who were known
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>to be so backward in many things, should have taken a
fancy to a work which was considered as a touchstone
of rare literary taste in England. I alluded to the
difficulties of the classicism of the style—the scholarly
quality of the verse.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But is it written in verse?” he asked. And when
I explained to him that “Paradise Lost” was as
literary a work as the Æneid he perfectly understood
the incredulity of the English public. As a matter
of fact, it is not at all difficult to understand and even
to explain why the Russian peasant likes “Paradise
Lost.” It is popular in exactly the same way as
Bunyan’s “Pilgrim’s Progress” has always been popular
in England. Was it not Dr. Johnson who said that
Bunyan’s work was great because, while it appealed
to the most refined critical palate, it was understood
and enjoyed by the simplest of men, by babes and
sucklings? This remark applies to the case of
“Paradise Lost” and the Russian peasant. The fact
therefore is not surprising, as would be, for instance,
the admiration of Tommy Atkins for a translation of
Lucretius. It is no more and no less surprising than
the popularity of Bunyan or of any epic story or
fairy tale. When people laugh and say that these
tastes are the inventions of essayists they forget that
the epics of the world were the supply resulting from
the demand caused by the deeply-rooted desire of
human nature for stories—long stories of heroic deeds
in verse; the further you go back the more plainly
this demand and supply is manifest. Therefore in
Russia among the peasants, a great many of whom
cannot read, the desire for epics is strong at this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>moment. And those who can read prefer an epic tale
to a modern novel.</p>

<p class='c011'>Besides this, “Paradise Lost” appeals to the peasants
because it is not only epic, full of fantasy and episode,
but also because it is religious, and, like children, they
prefer a story to be true. In countries where few people
read or write, memory flourishes, and in Russian
villages there are regular tellers of fairy tales (<em>skashi</em>)
who hand down from generation to generation fairy
tales of incredible length in prose and in verse.</p>

<p class='c011'>But to return to my friend the schoolmaster. I
asked him if “Paradise Lost” was still popular in the
village. “Yes,” he answered, “they come and ask
me for it every year. Unfortunately,” he added, “I
may not have it in the school library as it is not on
the list of books which are allowed by the censor. It is
not forbidden; but it is not on the official list of books
for school use.” Then he said that after all his experience
the taste of the peasants in literature baffled
him. “They will not read modern stories,” he said.
“When I ask them why they like ‘Paradise Lost’ they
point to their heart and say, ‘It is near to the heart; it
speaks; you read and a sweetness comes to you.’
Gogol they do not like. On the other hand they ask
for a strange book of adventures, about a Count or
a Baron.” “Baron Munchausen?” I suggested. “No,”
he said, “a Count.” “Not Monte Cristo?” I asked.
“Yes,” he said, “that is it. And what baffles me more
than all is that they like Dostoievski’s ‘Letters from a
Dead House.’” (Dostoievski’s record of his life in
prison in Siberia.) Their taste does not to me personally
seem to be so baffling. As for Dostoievski’s book, I am
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>certain they recognise its great truth, and they feel the
sweetness and simplicity of the writer’s character, and
this “speaks” to them also. As for “Monte Cristo,” is
not the beginning of it epical? It was a mistake,
he said, to suppose the peasants were unimaginative.
Sometimes this was manifested in a curious manner.
There was a peasant who was well known as a great
drunkard. In one of his fits of drink he imagined that
he had sold his wife to the “Tzar of Turkey,” and that
at midnight her head must be cut off. As the hour
drew near he wept bitterly, said goodbye to his wife,
and fetching an axe said with much lamentation
that this terrible deed had to be done because he had
promised her life to the “Tzar of Turkey.” The
neighbours eventually interfered and stopped the execution.</p>

<p class='c011'>When one is searching for curious types it generally
happens that you find one under your very nose. This
was my case the other day. There is in the village
another school which has lately been built for the
factory children by the Government. I strolled into
it and was received by a young schoolmaster with long
black hair who was conducting, in the same room, three
separate classes of children of different ages, to which
he was respectively and simultaneously teaching reading,
writing, and arithmetic (<em>i.e.</em>, reading to one class,
writing to the second, and arithmetic to the third). In
the interval between two lessons he took me into his
room and talked. His room was next to the schoolroom.
It was like the school, made of oak boards,
neither papered nor carpeted. There was no furniture
in his sitting-room, except a tiny table and a stool, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>in a further room no furniture at all except a violin
on the floor. The Government had given the wood
with which to build the school, he said; and when
it arrived the peasants whose children were to go
to the school had begun to saw and build, and then
had refused to go on with the work. However, it
was eventually built. “Who supports it?” I asked.
“Well,” he answered, “at present the Government
have no funds for schools, and the peasants refuse
to pay for it, so I have to support it myself. The
expenses are not great.” His salary consists of £36 a
year, out of which he supplies the school-books and
paper, pens, &#38;c. He seemed to like his work and
to take a great interest in the peasants. “The factory
peasants are far more developed than the ordinary
peasants,” he said. “Some of them take an interest
in astronomy. But the peasants are dark people,
difficult to get to know, and infinitely cunning.” “Do
you play the violin?” I asked, pointing to the violin
case. “Yes,” he answered, “but I don’t know how
I play.” I have never seen so poignant a symbol of
loneliness and the absence of the comforts of life as
this young schoolmaster in his bare wooden room. He
seemed, however, perfectly cheerful, and said that his
present situation was a great improvement on the last
one, which had been a mastership in a school near
Morshansk, where he slept in the same room as forty
other people, and where in winter the atmosphere was
so thick at night that they had to open the door. To
this the bare room with the violin on the floor seemed
indeed preferable.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>“Public affairs,” Dr. Johnson once said, “vex no
man.” And when Boswell objected that he had
seen Dr. Johnson vexed on this account the sage replied
thus: “Sir, I have never slept an hour less, nor ate
an ounce less meat. I would have knocked the factious
dogs on the head, to be sure; but I was not vexed.”
This seems to me to be an exact definition of the
attitude of the Russian public towards politics at this
moment. They are not vexed, but they are anxious
to knock the factious dogs on the head. The trouble is
that each party considers the other parties to be the
factious dogs, and the Government considers nearly
all the parties to be factious dogs; and all parties
without exception (Radical, Extreme, and Conservative)
consider the Government to be a factious dog. I will
describe briefly the present position of principal parties
and their more important subdivisions.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Right (the monarchical party and the Alliance
of Russian People) is for the Throne and the Altar
and against all compromise. They consider constitutional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>promises to have been exacted by the terrorism
of factious dogs.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the Centre there are, slightly towards the Right,
the party of Law and Order, the party of Commerce
and Industry, and slightly veering towards the Left
the Alliance of October 17th. At this moment the
two branches I have mentioned first (Law and Order
and Commerce and Industry) have veered from the
Right towards the Left; they say that the Government
is their common enemy. However, the main fact
with regard to them is that these three branches of
the Centre, of which the Alliance of October 17th is
far the most important, are all constitutional and
all moderate. There are further subdivisions in the
Centre about which we need not trouble ourselves.</p>

<p class='c011'>These three parties are united in desiring the
preservation of the Monarchy on a thoroughly
constitutional basis and that of the Unity of the
Empire. They differ on various other questions. The
Alliance of October 17th is in favour of universal
suffrage.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Constitutional Democrats, or Cadets, are in
favour of universal suffrage, local autonomy for Poland
(which they wish placed in the same position as Finland),
and one Chamber. They say nothing of the
Monarchy. They are a very strong and active party,
and their leaders are notable men, such as Professor
Milioukov, MM. Struve, Rodichev, and Petrunkevitch,
nearly all of whom are brilliant orators. The Government
has been so active in repressive measures against
this party that it is difficult to foresee how strongly
they will be represented in the Duma. The Moderate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>parties accuse them of promising more than they can
give and of saying less than they mean; in fact, of
being Federalists and Socialists in disguise, and not
having the honesty and the courage to admit the fact
for fear of arousing hostility among the peasants.
On the Left of the Left are the Socialists, the Social Democrats,
and the Social Revolutionaries.</p>

<p class='c011'>The elections are taking place now. I tried during
the whole of yesterday to grasp thoroughly the working
of the franchise law. I failed to grasp it. I asked one
Russian how many degrees there were in the suffrage.
He said four. I asked another; he said three. I asked
a third; he said two.</p>

<p class='c011'>However, what has happened in twenty-five Governments
as far as the peasants are concerned is this: the
peasants have elected delegates for their districts. Each
district elects a delegate. The delegate elects an
elector and the elector elects the member. That is
one part of the process. Three degrees. The result
of these elections was that out of 222 districts in 23
Ouiezds 99 districts elected supporters of the Government,
and 123 more or less Progressive candidates.
Yesterday the small landed proprietors elected their
representatives in the Government of Moscow; out
of 100 candidates returned 20 Constitutional Democrats
only were elected. Yesterday also, in St. Petersburg,
elections were held among the working men of the
factories. This led to nothing, since the working men
boycotted the proceedings.</p>

<p class='c011'>The first peasant who was chosen as a delegate for
his district in the Government of Moscow was arrested
on the 13th inst. It happened like this: The peasants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>met to elect a representative. Amongst them there was
one man who, without having any definite political
convictions, was able to make a fair speech. He was
unanimously elected. The police, who were present,
confronted with this apparently unforeseen contingency
(that some one would be elected), and in doubt as to
what to do, arrested him. He protested, saying that he
had been unanimously chosen as the people’s delegate.
“Oh!” said the police, “you are a <em>kreekòon</em>, are you?
The Circular of the Minister of the Interior tells us to
arrest all <em>kreekòons</em>; to prison you go.” A <em>kreekòon</em>
means a person who is turbulent, who cries out, objects,
or makes any kind of disturbance. So arrested he was.
The peasants, left without a candidate, thought that this
time they would elect some one who could not possibly
be accused of being a <em>kreekòon</em>, so they chose a very
old man over ninety years of age. This man, although
admirably fitted by the suavity of his demeanour to
fulfil the necessary conditions, could neither read nor
write, nor even hold a pen so as to scratch his mark. So
he was disqualified. In his place another octogenarian,
who still had strength enough left in his palsied fingers
to scratch a mark on paper, was chosen. In other
districts the peasants, hearing of this proceeding, elected
the village elder or the policeman so as to avoid possible
trouble. This, however, is against the rules, so they
had to fall back on octogenarians. In mills and
factories the employers encourage this plan so as to
avoid friction with the authorities. It is perhaps fair
to add that the elections are probably not in all cases
so farcical as they are made out to be. But in one case
some workmen who wished to boycott the elections
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>and were frightened into voting elected a man who
was deaf and dumb.</p>

<p class='c011'>The general feeling prevails that the Duma, whatever
the result of the elections may be, will be a profoundly
unsatisfactory machine. The Socialists look upon the
situation with hope. They say that the Duma will
either be red, in which case it will be dissolved by the
Government; or black, in which case it will be destroyed
by the Revolutionaries; or moderate, in which case
it will be composed of such conflicting elements
that the confusion which will ensue will render its
existence impossible. Most of the Moderate Central
Parties are veering towards an alliance with those of the
Left, owing to the intense exasperation which is felt
against the Government. At the meetings held by these
Central Moderate Parties violently anti-Governmental
speeches are made, and greeted with thunderous
applause.</p>

<p class='c011'>The elections have taken place here to-day; and, as
in St. Petersburg last week, the struggle lies between
the Constitutional Democrats or Cadets and the union
of the three Moderate parties (the Alliance of October
17th, the Party of Commerce and Industry, and the
Party of Rightful Order), which calls itself the
“Block.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In Moscow the conservative element, represented by
the Party of Commerce and Industry, is said to be
strong; there are strong conservative elements in the
town; on the other hand the Cadets are exceedingly
hopeful. The result of the elections will be known
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>to-morrow night. When the results of the elections
were made public in St. Petersburg the attitude of the
Right and of the October Party was curious. They said
with one voice that it was not fair, that many of the
electors had not received their voting cards, and that
the elections should be cancelled. It was pointed out
that possibly many of the Cadets had not received their
voting cards either, but that they had taken the trouble
to go and fetch them. Every possible explanation was
given for the victory of the Cadets save the one that the
majority of voters were in sympathy with their programme,
and had therefore elected them. The situation
recalled the state of feeling after the last General
Election in England. During the weeks that preceded
the elections the Cadets complained, and in many cases
with good grounds, that their efforts in canvassing and
electoral agitation generally were being seriously
impeded by the police. Their one cry has been all
along: “We are not revolutionaries. We are a political
party. And we are being treated as revolutionaries.”
(The Social Revolutionaries are not taking part in the
elections at all.) Somebody lately pointed out to me
that if, in spite of all the measures taken against the
Cadets, they still succeed in obtaining a majority, the
result of the repressive measures will have been to
secure a representative Duma. He meant that whether
the Cadets are right or wrong, it is evident that they
are infinitely more energetic and more capable of action
than their adversaries, so that if they obtain a
moderate success we shall be justified in concluding
that, had they been in no way impeded, they would have
obtained an overwhelming success; in which case the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>Duma would have been representative exclusively of
the more energetic opinion in Russia, and not, therefore,
fairly representative of the whole opinion.</p>

<p class='c011'>To understand their success one has only to read their
programme. It is a little book which costs three
kopecks, <em>i.e.</em>, two-thirds of a halfpenny. It lays down
shortly, precisely, and in perspicuous language everything
which those people desire who wish for a radical
change of <i><span lang="fr">régime</span></i> in Russia: (1) The equality of citizens
before the law. (2) Freedom of religion. (3) Freedom
of speech and of the Press. (4) The right to hold
public meetings. (5) The right to form clubs
and unions. (6) The right of petition. (7) The inviolability
of the individual and his domicile (<i><span lang="la">habeas
corpus</span></i>). (8) Abolition of illegal punishments and
extraordinary Courts. (9) Freedom of the citizen to
leave his country and abolition of the passport system.
(10) The incorporation of the above-mentioned rights in
the fundamental laws of the country. These ten clauses,
which could be written on less than half a sheet of notepaper
(I have just copied them from the official
programme), form the basis of their creed. Besides
these there are further and more detailed articles concerning
the political organisation of the State; among
which there is one which lays down that the representatives
of the people should be elected by universal,
equal, direct suffrage carried out by ballot, without
distinction of religion, nationality, or sex. (There is a
qualifying clause as to whether the introduction of
woman’s suffrage shall be immediate or not, which is
not very clear.) The Cadets themselves say that their
future behaviour depends entirely on the Government,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>and that they have no wish to go further to the Left
unless the Government push them thither.</p>

<p class='c011'>I went to look at the voting in one of the districts
this morning. It took place on the third floor of a
minor place of entertainment. A small crowd was
collected outside, getting thick around the door; at the
door and on the staircase were canvassers of the two
camps, those of the Cadets being mostly students.
Upstairs a long string of people were waiting to vote in
alphabetical order, and in a further room, of which I
could get but a glimpse, I saw a green baize table and
some respectable people sitting at it. The whole proceeding
was orderly in the extreme. There has been
nothing in the town to-day to tell the casual tourist that
elections are going on, although the interest in them
is keen.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is Palm Sunday, and therefore the customary fair
is being held on the Red Place in front of the Kremlin,
and as it has been a lovely day the crowd of strollers
was immense. This fair is one of the most amusing
sights to be seen in Russia. Two lines of booths occupy
the space which stretches opposite the walls of the
Kremlin. At the booths you can buy almost anything:
birds, tortoises, goldfish, grass snakes, linoleum, carpets,
toys, knives, musical instruments, books, music, cakes,
lace, ikons, Easter eggs, carved woodwork, &#38;c. There
are besides these a number of semi-official stalls where
kwass is sold to drink, and a great quantity of itinerant
vendors sell balloons, things that squeak, penny
whistles, trumpets, and chenille monkeys. The trade in
goldfish was brisk (people often buying one goldfish in
a small tumbler), but that in a special kind of whetstone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>which cut glass and sharpened knives and cost twenty
kopecks was briskest of all. The crowd round this
stall, at which the vendor gave a continual exhibition of
the practical excellence of his wares by cutting up bits
of glass, was dense, and he sold any quantity of them.
At the bookstall the selection was varied in the
extreme; I bought two cheap copies of “Paradise
Lost” in Russian with wonderful illustrations, but there
were also back numbers of <cite>Punch</cite> to be got, some
fragments of the <cite>Cornhill Magazine</cite>, and the Irish State
Papers from 1584 to 1588. One man was selling silvered
Caucasian whips which, he said, had just missed being
silver. One man sold little sailors made of chenille,
which, he said, represented the crew of the <em>Potemkin</em>
without the captain. There was one fascinating
booth called an American bazaar where everything
cost five kopecks, and where you could buy almost
anything.</p>

<p class='c011'>I did not, to my regret, find at the bookstall
a magazine which, I am told, has recently been published
for children—children in the nursery, not schoolboys.
It forms part of a series of publications
resembling the “Bibliothèque Rose” in France. This
magazine, I am told, leads off with an article on Herzen
(the famous writer on Socialistic questions), and then
continues with a cartoon of a man in chains in a
dungeon, having dreamt of freedom, and waking to find
he is bound; another cartoon follows representing a
gallows, or some other such cheerful symbol, and it ends
with an article on America, in which it is explained
that the children in the United States have initiated and
are carrying on a movement and agitation in favour of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>the extension of suffrage to the nursery.  This is what
I think is called a sign of the times.</p>

<p class='c011'>Certainly Russia is quite different from all other
countries, and by saying it is the most Western of
Oriental nations you get no nearer an explanation of its
characteristics than by saying it is the most Oriental
of Western nations. You live here, walk about, talk,
and forget that you are in a place which is quite unique,
until some small sight or episode or phrase brings home
the fact to you, and you say “This is Russia,” as
Vernon Lee in her exquisite book on “The Spirit of
Rome” exclaims, “This is Rome,” when driving towards
Monte Maggiore she hears the sound of the harmonium,
and the school-children’s hymn issuing out of a piece of
broken ruin covered with fennel. Such a moment has
just occurred to me to-night, when driving home
through the empty streets at 11 p.m. I passed a church
as the clock struck, and I heard a voice speaking loud
quite close to me; I turned round and saw a policeman
standing on the pavement, having faced about towards
the church. He was saying his prayers in a loud singsong;
his whole body was swaying as he repeatedly
crossed himself; in his arms he carried a twig of
budding willow, which is the symbol of the palm-branches
of to-day’s festival; these branches yesterday
and to-day have been sold and carried about all over
Russia. Palm Sunday here is called the Feast of the
Willow-branches. When I saw this policeman saying
his prayers I experienced that peculiar twinge of
recognition which made me think: “This is Russia.”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>I have spent Easter in various cities—in Rome,
Florence, Athens, and Hildesheim—and, although
in each of these places the feast has its own peculiar
aspect, yet by far the most impressive and the most
interesting celebration of the Easter festival I have ever
witnessed is that of Moscow. This is not to be wondered
at, for Easter, as is well known, is the most important
feast of the year in Russia, the season of festivity and
holiday-making in a greater degree than Christmas or
New Year’s Day. Secondly, Easter, which is kept with
equal solemnity all over Russia, is especially interesting
in Moscow, because Moscow is the stronghold of old
traditions, and the city of churches. Even more than
Cologne, it is</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>There is a church almost in every street, and the
Kremlin is a citadel of cathedrals. During Holy
Week, towards the end of which the evidences of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>fasting season grow more and more obvious by the
closing of restaurants and the impossibility of buying
any wine and spirits, there are, of course, services every
day. During the first three days of Holy Week there
is a curious ceremony to be seen every two years in the
Kremlin. That is the preparation of the chrism or holy
oil. While it is slowly stirred and churned in great
cauldrons, filling the room with hot fragrance, a deacon
reads the Gospel without ceasing (he is relieved at
intervals by others), and this lasts day and night for
three days. On Maundy Thursday it is removed in
silver vessels to the Cathedral. The supply has to last
the whole of Russia for two years. I went to the morning
service in the Cathedral of the Assumption on
Maundy Thursday. “It’s long, but it’s very, very
beautiful.” The church is crowded to suffocation.
Everybody is standing up, as there would be no room
to kneel. The church is lit with countless small wax
tapers. The priests are clothed in white and silver.
The singing of the noble plain chant without any
accompaniment ebbs and flows in perfectly disciplined
harmonies; the bass voices are unequalled in the world.
Every class of the population is represented in the
church. There are no seats, no pews, no precedence
or privilege. There is a smell of incense and a still
stronger smell of poor people, without which, some one
said, a church is not a church. On Good Friday there
is the service of the Holy Shroud, and besides this a
later service in which the Gospel is read out in fourteen
different languages, and finally a service beginning at
one o’clock in the morning and ending at four, which
commemorates the Burial of Our Lord. How the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>priests endure the strain of these many and exceedingly
long services is a thing to be wondered at; for
the fast, which is strictly kept during all this period,
precludes butter, eggs, and milk, in addition to all
the more solid forms of nourishment, and the services
are about six times as long as those of the Roman
Catholic or other Churches.</p>

<p class='c011'>The most solemn service of the year takes place at
midnight on Saturday. From eight until ten o’clock
the town, which during the day had been crowded with
people buying provisions and presents and Easter eggs,
seems to be asleep and dead. At about ten people begin
to stream towards the Kremlin. At eleven o’clock there
is already a dense crowd, many of the people holding
lighted tapers, waiting outside in the square, between
the Cathedral of the Assumption and that of Ivan
Veliki. A little before twelve the cathedrals and
palaces on the Kremlin are all lighted up with ribbons
of various coloured lights. Twelve o’clock strikes, and
then the bell of Ivan Veliki begins to boom: a beautiful
full-voiced, immense volume of sound—a sound which
Clara Schumann said was the most beautiful she had
ever heard. Then it is answered by other bells, and a
little later all the bells of all the churches in Moscow
are ringing together. Then from the cathedral comes
the procession; the singers first in crimson and gold;
the bearers of the gilt banners; then the Metropolitan,
also in stiff robes of crimson and gold, and after him the
officials in their uniforms. They walk round the cathedral
to look for the Body of Our Lord, and return to
the cathedral to tell the news that He is risen. Then
the guns go off, rockets are fired, and illuminations are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>seen across the river, lighting up the distant cupola of
the great Church of the Saviour with a cloud of fire.</p>

<p class='c011'>The crowd begins to disperse and to pour into the
various churches. I went to the Manège—an enormous
riding school, in which the Ekaterinoslav Regiment has
its church. Half the building looked like a fair. Long
tables, twinkling with hundreds of wax tapers, were
loaded with the three articles of food which are eaten
at Easter; a huge cake called koulich; a kind of sweet
cream made of curds and eggs, cream, and sugar, called
Pascha (Easter); and Easter eggs, dipped and dyed
in many colours. They are there waiting to be blessed.
The church itself was a tiny little recess on one side
of the building. There the priests were officiating and
down below in the centre of the building the whole
regiment was drawn up. There are two services—the
service which begins at midnight, and which lasts about
half an hour, and Mass, which follows immediately after
it, lasting till about three in the morning. At the end
of the first service, when “Christ is risen” is sung, the
priest kisses the congregation three times and then the
congregation kiss each other, one person saying “Christ
is risen” and the other answering “He is risen, indeed.”
The colonel kisses the sergeant; the sergeant kisses
all the men one after another. While this ceremony
was proceeding I left and went to the Church of the
Saviour, where the first service was not yet over. Here
the crowd was so dense that it was almost impossible
to get into the church, although it is immense. The
singing in this church is ineffable, and it is worth while
coming to Moscow simply for the sake of hearing it.
I waited until the end of the first service and then I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>was borne by the crowd to one of the narrow entrances
and hurled through the doorway outside. The crowd
was not rough, they were not jostling one another, but
with cheerful carelessness people dived into it as you
dive into a scrimmage at football, and propelled the
unresisting herd towards the entrance; the result being,
of course, that a mass of people got wedged into the
doorway and the process of getting out took infinitely
longer than it need have done, and had there been a
panic nothing could have prevented one’s being crushed
to death. After this I went to a friend’s house to break
the fast and eat koulich, Pascha, and Easter eggs, and
finally returned home when the dawn was faintly shining
on the dark waters of the Moscow river, whence the ice
disappeared only last week.</p>

<p class='c011'>This morning people come to bring one Easter
greetings and to give one Easter eggs and to receive
gifts. I was writing in my sitting-room, and I heard
a faint mutter in the next room, a small voice murmuring,
“Gospodi, Gospodi” (“Lord, Lord”). I went
to see who it was and found it was the policeman,
sighing for his tip, not wishing to disturb, but at the
same time anxious to indicate his presence. He
brought me a crimson egg. Then came the doorkeeper
and the cook. And the policeman must, I
think, have been pleased with his tip, because
policemen have been coming ever since, and there are
not more than two who belong to my street.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the afternoon I went to a hospital for wounded
soldiers to see them keep Easter, which they did by
playing blind man’s buff to the sound of a flute played
by one poor man who is crippled for life. One of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>soldiers gave me as an Easter gift a poem, which
I will translate literally as it is a curious human
document. It is called “Past and Present.” This one
is “Present”:—</p>

fairs or markets in the town, where there are a
great quantity of booths. Everything is sold here, and
here the people buy their clothes. They are now
buying their summer yachting caps. One man offered
me a stolen gold watch for a small sum. Another
begged me to buy him a pair of cheap boots. I did
so; upon which he said: “Now that you have made
half a man of me, make a whole man of me by buying
me a jacket.” I refused, however, to make a whole
man of him.</p>

<p class='c011'>To-day I went out to luncheon with some friends in
the “Intelligenzia.” We were a large party, and one of
the guests was an officer who had been to the war.
Towards the end of luncheon, when everybody was
convivial, healths were drunk, and one young man, who
proclaimed very loudly that he was a social revolutionary,
drank to the health of the Republic. I made
great friends with the social revolutionary during
luncheon. When this health was drunk I was extremely
alarmed as to what the officer might do. But
the officer turned out to be this man’s brother. The
officer himself made a speech which was, I think, the
most brilliant example of compromise I have ever
heard; for he expressed his full sympathy with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>Liberal movement in Russia, including its representatives
in the extreme parties, and at the same time he
expressed his unalterable loyalty to his Sovereign.</p>

<p class='c011'>After luncheon the social revolutionary, who had
sworn eternal friendship to me, was told that I had
relations in London who managed a bank. So he came
up to me and said: “If <em>you</em> give our Government one
penny in the way of a loan I shall shoot you dead.”</p>

<p class='c011'>After that we danced for the rest of the afternoon.
The social revolutionary every now and then inveighed
against loans and expressed his hope that the Government
would be bankrupt.</p>

<p class='c011'>I was looking out of the window this morning and
saw the policeman who watches over my house,
and often helps with the luggage, apparently arrest
and walk off with a workman. I ran out of the
house and said—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are you taking that man to the police station?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“God be with him, no,” said the policeman. “Why
should I arrest him? Do you want him arrested? He
is ‘having taken drink,’ and I am taking him to a
friend’s house, where he can rest.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The policeman had thought I was complaining
because he was not going to be arrested. This incident
amused me, as being typical of the good-nature
of a class of people who are represented as savage
tyrants.</p>

<p class='c011'>This afternoon, wishing to talk over the topics of the
day and the political outlook, I went to see a friend of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>mine, a certain Dimitri Nikolaievitch A——. Dimitri
Nikolaievitch was a failure. He had started life with
smiling prospects and the promise of a bright future,
but he wasted his youth and his fortune in dissipation,
and after spending some years in the Government
service as an official he retired and embarked upon a
journalistic venture; but, since he was entirely devoid of
ambition, hopelessly unpractical, and fundamentally
uncompetitive he failed, and was soon forced to abandon
an enterprise which left him burdened with debts.
He now earns a scanty income by giving lessons in
Russian to foreigners. His whole literary production
is confined to one or two suggestive literary and historical
pamphlets long since out of print. I found him
at home in his room, which is on the sixth floor of
a large barrack in a remote quarter of the town. The
landing on which he lives swarms with inhabitants, and
a whole bevy of tailors were busily at work in the room
opposite to his. His room is small, and scantily furnished
with a chair, a table, a low bed, a few frameless
photographs stuck on the wall, a mandoline, a guitar,
and a <em>babalaika</em>. The room is also inhabited by a bullfinch,
a green lizard, and a fox terrier. Dimitri Nikolaievitch
himself looks younger than he is; he is rather
fat, with fair, unkempt hair, very light blue eyes lighting
up a wrinkled and rather puffy and unshaved face;
his jacket is stained and lacking in buttons.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know why you have come,” he said to me as I
entered the room; “you have got to write an article
and you want copy.” “Exactly,” I answered. “Why
do you come to me? Why don’t you interview the
flower of our officialdom or some of our future Robespierres
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>and Dantons?” he asked. “You know as well
as I do why I come to you for ideas,” I said; “with all
those people the wish is father to the thought. You
have long ago ceased to wish about political matters,
and so your point of view is quite unbiassed, besides
which——” “I know,” he interrupted; “you needn’t go
on, but before we talk of what is happening I want to
tell you that I have finished my historical work.”
“What work?” I asked. “I think I told you,” he said,
“that I contemplated—now that forbidden thoughts
are allowed an unwonted freedom—writing a short
history of the reign of the Emperor Nicholas II. I
have begun and finished it. It took me ten minutes.
I thought it was going to take longer, but last night
I happened to open the Old Testament, and I found
that the history of the reign of Nicholas II. had already
been written in the First Book of Kings more concisely
than I had intended writing it. Listen, I will read it to
you.” He took a Bible from the table and read: “‘And
Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come
to Shechem to make him King. And it came to pass
when Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who was yet in
Egypt, heard of it&#160;... that they sent and called him.
And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came,
and spake unto Rehoboam, saying, Thy father made
our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous
service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he
put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee. And he
said unto them, Depart yet for three days, then come
again to me. And the people departed. And King
Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood
before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>How do ye advise that I may answer this people?
And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a
servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them
and answer them, and speak good words to them, then
they will be thy servants for ever. But he forsook the
counsel of the old men&#160;... and consulted with the
young men that were grown up with him,&#160;... and he
said unto them, What counsel give ye?... and the
young men&#160;... spake unto him saying, Thus shalt
thou speak unto this people:... My little finger shall
be thicker than my father’s loins. And now whereas
my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add
to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with whips,
but I will chastise you with scorpions. So Jeroboam
and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as
the King had appointed.... And the King answered
the people roughly, and forsook the old men’s counsel&#160;...
and spake to them after the counsel of the young
men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and
I will add to your yoke: my father also chastised you
with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
Wherefore the King hearkened not unto the people....
So when all Israel saw that the King hearkened
not unto them, the people answered the King, saying,
What portion have we in David?... To your tents,
O Israel.... So Israel departed unto their tents....
Therefore King Rehoboam made speed to get him up
to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem. So Israel rebelled
against the house of David.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is the whole history of the reign of Nicholas II.,
and it is the history of many other reigns also. There
are no new elements in history. History is a kaleidoscope
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>containing a limited number of bits of many-coloured
glass, which, by being perpetually shaken,
form patterns which recur, and combinations which
seem new, but which in reality have been before and
will be again. That is why the people who are snubbed
for saying the revolutionary movement in Russia
resembles the French Revolution are not so far wrong,
because the same causes produce the same effects, and
the situations, though superficially widely different, are
alike in their essentials. Well, what is it you want to
talk to me about?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I want to know what you think of the present
situation,” I answered. “Providence,” said Dimitri
Nikolaievitch, “has been kind to the Government in
vouchsafing them a foreign loan, in spite of the German
Emperor’s disapproval.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you think that the bitterness it has created
among the parties of the Left is a serious matter?”
I interrupted.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No,” said Dimitri Nikolaievitch, “I do not; and
for this reason: I think that all talk about the loan
now is, as Hamlet said, ‘Words, words, words.’ What
does it all amount to? The Government say that
unless the loan had been made before the Duma had
met national bankruptcy would have ensued. The
Liberals say a fortnight more or less could not have
mattered, and the Government made the loan to be
independent of the Duma. To which it is answered
that the money is obviously for past deficits and not
for present schemes. But, say others, the real reason
why the loan was made before the Duma met was that
had it not been made the Government would have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>absolutely at the mercy of the Duma. ‘That is exactly
what we wanted,’ say the Social revolutionaries, because,
short of such pressure, the Government will never do
anything constitutional. ‘The Government should have
trusted the patriotism of the Duma to accept the loan,’
say the Liberals. ‘The foreign bankers have dealt a
dastardly blow at the movement for Russian freedom,’
say the Social revolutionaries. I say that this is all
‘Words, words, words.’ The money was imperatively
necessary. National bankruptcy cannot be the best
springboard for the initial leap of the Duma. And as
to its effect on the movement of liberation—that is, I
believe, the polite term for what I call the Revolution—I
do not believe that it matters one straw. Supposing
the loan had been postponed, the bitterness against the
Government would not have been lessened, and national
bankruptcy would not have made the situation any
easier for the Cadets. You will object that the Social
revolutionaries probably would have welcomed national
bankruptcy. Of course, everything depends on the
action of the Government now. What will happen?
This Ministry cannot face the Duma. M. Durnovo
will have to resign. It has been published all this
week in the newspapers that Count Witte has resigned.
We infer from this that Count Witte intends either to
remain without M. Durnovo or to leave. But supposing
his resignation is accepted and M. Durnovo remains?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But you do not think——” I interrupted.</p>

<p class='c011'>“All things are possible,” rejoined Dimitri Nikolaievitch;
“remember that; because a course is suicidal
that is no guarantee that it will not be taken; the
contrary rather is true. Remember the story of Rehoboam
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>I have just read you: ‘Es ist eine alte Geschichte,
doch bleibt sie immer neu.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But in any case,” I asked, “how do you think any
present or future Government will deal with the
Duma?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That depends,” he answered, “of course, on who has
to deal with it. If the Duma is prorogued after a short
session the situation will be hazardous. On the other
hand, the whole thing may go off without any great
cataclysm. The Cadets do not believe in the dispersal
of the Duma. But if we have to take for granted that
the higher authorities will behave wisely, in order to
ensure things going smoothly, our optimism is put to a
high trial. We have so few, we have not one precedent
for wise conduct on the part of our Government. There
is one comforting thing I can tell you, and that is that
I feel certain of this: Whatever cataclysms may occur,
in ten years’ time Russia will be in a flourishing condition.
Those who talk of Russia being financially
unsound talk nonsense. Look at the country now;
in spite of a disastrous war, a universal strike, other
strikes, revolution, and armed risings, trade is simply
humming. The head of one of your biggest English
firms here told me yesterday that except the iron
trade all the industries are in a flourishing condition.
Orders come pouring in. Therefore, as regards the
ultimate outlook I am optimistic, whatever happens in
the immediate future; whether everything goes jolting
on somehow, as may very well happen in Russia, or
whether there is a frightful crash in the month of May.
Both things are equally possible. So far what has
happened is simple. The autocracy was made bankrupt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>by the war—bankrupt morally, I mean. An
attempt was made to pass a sponge over the bankruptcy;
this led to a universal strike; then the bankruptcy
was recognised, and Count Witte was summoned
to liquidate the affairs of the old firm. The liquidation
was necessarily a troublous time; nobody was anxious
to be concerned in it; certainly none of the people who
intended to join the new firm later. Therefore members
of the old firm had to be chosen. They got somewhat
out of hand. Now the liquidation has come to a close.
The new firm is going to start business. If it is impeded
it will blow up the bank with dynamite and build a new
house. But such an explosion will only affect the staff
of the old establishment and not the resources of the
new firm, which are the kingdoms of Russia—an
incredibly rich and undeveloped concern. If you ask
my opinion, I do not think that any such explosion is
inevitable, but the Government will no doubt take
pains to bring it about. Three years ago a revolution
seemed to be an impossibility in Russia. The Government
have almost succeeded in making the reverse an
improbability.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But all this is, as I told you, ‘Words, words, words,’
and I refuse to say another word about politics.”</p>

</div>

<div class='lg-container-r c002'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Sosnofka</span>, <em>April 29th</em>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>To understand the cause of the present state of
agriculture in Russia, owing to the disastrous
nature of which the agricultural question is the acutest
of the problems which have to be settled by the
Duma, it is necessary to go back to the time of the
emancipation of the serfs.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is from this epoch that the ruin of Russian
agriculture primarily dates; it was then that the first
crash occurred, and it was due to the following causes.
The landlords, who had been accustomed to obtain
manual labour for nothing, proved incapable of adapting
themselves at once to the new conditions, and they did
one of two things. They either spent the money they
received from the Government in return for the land
which they had given up in fruitless efforts to make
agricultural improvements—fruitless because, being
devoid of practical knowledge, they did what was not
necessary and left undone what was imperative; or
they simply spent the money anyhow until they had
none left. Hence agricultural depression. Half the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>landlords in Russia disappeared, and their vacant
places were occupied firstly in a small degree by
peasants, and secondly in a greater degree by merchants,
who were determined to extract the uttermost
farthing from their possessions. In this manner there
came into existence a new and mixed class of landed
proprietors, who can be divided into two principal
sections: (1) Those who let all their land to the
peasants; (2) those who endeavoured as far as possible
to carry on agriculture rationally, and arrived, in spite
of the obstacles inherent in the circumstances, at
comparatively good results.</p>

<p class='c011'>As everybody is probably now aware, the question
of expropriation of private property is being brought
forward as a solution of the land question. And the
question of expropriation as it is now being discussed
applies to the second as well as the first class of
proprietors mentioned above. With regard to the
first class there is no possible argument against the
expropriation of all their land. With regard to the
second class, their land, considered from the point of
view of the State, represents a considerable asset. If
this land were immediately to be handed over in entirety
to the peasants, the value that it represents to the State
would cease to exist, because the peasants have not at
this moment the means of keeping the output of the
land up to its present level. And it would be impossible
at this moment for the State to provide them
with the necessary means. It is just because the
peasants are without the necessary means—because,
in a word, they are too poor—that they are asking
for more land.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>Therefore, from the point of view of the State,
it is clear that if a plan of wholesale expropriation
is put into practice the immediate results will be a
decrease of public revenue and an increase of agricultural
depression all over Russia. If we look at
the question from the point of view of the peasants,
the relief which they would obtain by wholesale
expropriation would be only of a temporary nature,
even if we presuppose that the distribution of land
could be carried out on the same scale and in the
same proportion as at the time of the emancipation
of the serfs, which is improbable. The relief would
be only temporary, because owing to the constant
increase of the population the land would dwindle
in an equally constant and increasing process of
subdivision, and the State would be unable to come
to the aid of the peasants and to furnish them with
the means of improving their methods of agriculture,
owing to the fall of revenue occasioned as aforesaid
by the expropriation.</p>

<p class='c011'>Besides the expropriation of private property, what
further solutions are suggested? There are two further
schemes which are under discussion: expropriation of
the lands belonging to the State, and emigration into
the undeveloped portions of the Russian Empire.
There are in Russia large stretches of land belonging
to the State and to the Crown; but they consist
principally of woods, and it is therefore highly undesirable
that they should be touched, for since Russia
suffers from extremes of heat and cold, from dryness,
and from the continental quality of its climate, the
woods, which give moisture, are of the utmost value,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>especially at the present moment when so many woods
belonging to private landowners have been and are
being cut down.</p>

<p class='c011'>Next comes the question of emigration. There exist
in Siberia and Turkestan immense stretches of rich and
fertile country; this being so it is obvious that if an
emigration scheme could be carried out on a large scale
the land question would be on a fair way towards
settlement, and the State would be in possession of
fresh resources.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Left parties in general meet this plan with
two objections: they say (1) that the peasants are
not capable of adapting themselves to the new
local conditions of agriculture which they would
have to face; (2) that the expenses entailed by
the agricultural installation of the emigrants, who
would have to be provided with everything, could
not possibly be met, and that therefore emigration
cannot be regarded as a definite solution of the land
question.</p>

<p class='c011'>These objections are in their turn met with the
following counter-arguments. It is said that the first
objection has been proved to be groundless by the
cases of emigration in Turkestan, where it is seen that
the peasants who emigrate thither adapt themselves
with surprising facility and rapidity to new conditions,
which include a peculiarly complicated system of
irrigation, and have nothing in common with the
agricultural conditions of Russia proper. It might also
be stated that Russians in general, and the peasants
in particular, are a singularly adaptable race, as is
proved by the ease and the speed with which those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>who emigrate to Europe and America adapt themselves
to their altered circumstances.</p>

<p class='c011'>As to the second question, that of expense, it is
far more serious. But here it is objected that the
premises on which those who are opposed to emigration
on the grounds of expense base their arguments are
derived from the results obtained at an epoch when
emigration, like everything else, was as badly managed
as possible; and that owing to this bad management
hostility towards emigration was aroused among the
peasants themselves, who as it is, do not care
to leave their homes unless they are obliged to do
so. That emigration is one of the possible radical
methods of solving the land question is obvious. It
is further obvious that if it is to be adopted a system
of investigation into the suitability of places for emigration
and likewise a system of means of communication
must be organised. It is equally obvious that the
State must not only furnish material aid but moral
aid by furthering educational progress and the
amelioration of general culture by every means at
its disposal.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is hardly necessary to say now that up to the
present the State has acted in the contrary sense by
every means at its disposal. There was a moment
after the emancipation under Alexander II. when
this was not so, and efforts towards general improvement
were made; this epoch did not last long,
and progress was definitively checked by the reactionary
<i><span lang="fr">régime</span></i> of Alexander III., which reached
its culminating point under the reign of M. Plehve.
That it is feasible to make for progress in Russia and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>that this is not a Utopian ideal is proved by the
simple fact that in spite of all the obstacles created
by the Government, schools, instituted by the Zemstva,
have flourished, with the result that, roughly speaking,
40 per cent. of the younger generation in Russia can
now read and write, whereas at the time of the
emancipation of the serfs, when the Zemstva came
into existence, 2 per cent. only could read and write.</p>

<p class='c011'>This question—the promotion of universal culture
by which alone progress can come—is the most acute
of all the questions now existing in Russia, because
the country has been driven by the present system
to the extreme limits of its endurance—to the very
brink of ruin, to the uttermost desperation. And it
will not, therefore, be surprising if the reaction in the
opposite direction is equally violent, and Russia passes
from one extreme to the other; in which case those
who are responsible for not having put an end to
the present <i><span lang="fr">régime</span></i>, until they felt the knife at their
throats, and even then reluctantly, will find food for
not altogether cheerful reflection.</p>

<p class='c011'>I have been ten days in the country and have seen
the pageant of early spring in Russia. The trees are
not yet all green, but the blossom is out everywhere,
and the bees are buzzing round it and filling the air with
their noise. To-day we went to see the examination
held in the school. The children were examined in
Scripture, geography, and reading. I did not stay
the whole time. The children I heard acquitted themselves
splendidly. I was allowed to look over and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>mark some of the dictations. After the examination
was over we had dinner with the schoolmaster and
played “preference.” A neighbour, who looked in at
the schoolmaster’s, said that he was pleased to see the
Russian Government was coming to its senses in one
respect, and trying to arrive at an understanding with
the British Government.</p>

<p class='c011'>In a few days the Russian Parliament will be sitting,
the curtain will have risen, the drama will be in
full swing, and the echoes and impressions of to-day
will have been forgotten and superseded by the
rumour of more important events. And yet significant
things have happened in the last few days. The
resignation of Count Witte did not come as a surprise;
we knew during the last ten days that Count Witte
had sent in his resignation; but the resignation of
M. Durnovo was somewhat unexpected. It was
generally said that Count Witte would go, and that
M. Durnovo would remain.</p>

<p class='c011'>The popular attitude towards Count Witte during
the last year must be of singular interest to those to
whom the contemplation of human affairs affords a
melancholy amusement. The enthusiasm with which
the hero of Portsmouth was received; the further
enthusiasm created by his report to the Emperor; the
Manifesto of October 17th, which everybody knew would
not and could not have been but for Count Witte; then
the gradual tide of reaction; at first, faults but hinted
and dislike but hesitated; distrust, latent, but scarcely
expressed; then impatient questioning; conflicting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>criticism; manifold explanation; and very soon
unanimous blame, and venomous vituperation, hatred,
and abuse. When time has swept away the dust-clouds
of partiality, partisanship, and passion, the
work of Count Witte will stand out clear in the impartial
light of history. I do not think the verdict
can be a severe one. Count Witte’s task was to get
to the Duma somehow or other, to keep things going
until the Duma should meet, without a general breakdown.
This task he accomplished, and he has managed
to get a foreign loan into the bargain. That it was
an easy task not the most fanatical of his opponents
would say; that he was hampered on all sides is
obvious; that his instruments broke in his hands is
likewise obvious; that not only no shadow of loyal
co-operation was shown to him by his colleagues, but
that even his subordinates flatly refused to obey him,
was proved by one or two incidents which occurred
during the last fortnight, such as the case of the
Kharkov Professor, sent to exile by M. Durnovo, in
spite of Count Witte’s express and expressed desire,
and the case of M. Sipiagin, who was not permitted
to go to Sevastopol, in spite of Count Witte’s categorical
instructions. Whether Count Witte made the most
of his opportunities I do not know, and the man who
passes a sweeping judgment on this point will be bold;
but I am convinced of one thing, and that is that no
man in Russia would have performed the task which
was Count Witte’s, given the peculiar circumstances
of the case, better. Count Witte and M. Durnovo have
gone, and their places have been taken by a Cabinet
exclusively bureaucratical and reactionary. What is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>meaning of this? I asked some one yesterday whether
this Cabinet was meant to be of a temporary nature.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s put there to be kicked out,” he answered.
“Mind you, I mean <em>kicked</em> out,” he continued, “and
not to go of its own accord.” If this is the case, what
my friend Dimitri Nikolaievitch hinted to me at St.
Petersburg—namely, that the fact that a course was
fatal, so far from constituting a guarantee that it would
not be adopted, on the contrary weighed down the
balance of probabilities in its favour—has come true.
I cannot quite bring myself to believe it. It is only
when we turn to the past—to the history of revolutionary
movements in every country and at every epoch—that
we see how, in obedience to some mysterious law, a
fatal mist seems to blind those in authority, and how
they deliberately choose the disastrous course the perils
of which seem to us so obvious, and the avoidance
of which seems to us so simple. In 1769 Junius
addressed the King as follows:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“We separate the amiable, good-natured Prince from
the folly and treachery of his servants, and the private
virtues of the man from the vices of his Government.
Were it not for this just distinction I know not whether
your Majesty’s condition or that of the English people
would deserve most to be lamented.... Your subjects,
Sir, wish for nothing but that as <em>they</em> are reasonable
and affectionate enough to separate your person from
your Government; so <em>you</em>, in your turn, would distinguish
between the conduct which becomes the
permanent dignity of a King, and that which serves
only to promote the temporary interest and miserable
ambition of a Minister.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>In the same letter he wrote as follows about the
Army:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“From the uses to which one part of the Army has
been too frequently applied you have some reason to
expect that there are no services they would refuse.
Here, too, we trace the partiality of your understanding.
You take the sense of the Army from the
conduct of the Guards, with the same justice that you
collect the sense of the people from the representations
of the Ministry. Your marching regiments, sir, will not
make the Guards their example either as soldiers or
subjects. They feel and resent, as they ought to do,
that invariable undistinguishing favour with which the
Guards are treated; while those gallant troops, by
whom every hazardous, every laborious service is performed,
are left to perish in garrisons abroad or pine in
quarters at home, neglected and forgotten. If they had
no sense of the great original duty they owe their
country, their resentment would operate like patriotism,
and leave your cause to be defended by those on whom
you have lavished the rewards and honours of their
profession.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Finally, he makes an appeal which has been made at
all times and in all countries in times of popular dissatisfaction,
and has always been made in vain. The
words which I am about to quote embody what has
been thought in this country during all the last months
by the vast majority of thinking people, by all who
had brains to think and were not blinded by fanatical
rage.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Without consulting your Minister, call together your
whole Council. Let it appear to the public that you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>can determine and act for yourself. Come forward to
your people; lay aside the wretched formalities of a
king and speak to your subjects with the spirit of a
man and in the language of a gentleman. Tell them you
have been fatally deceived: the acknowledgment will be
no disgrace, but rather an honour to your understanding.
Tell them you are determined to remove every
cause of complaint against your Government; that you
will give your confidence to no man that does not
possess the confidence of your subjects; and leave to
themselves to determine, by their conduct at a future
election, whether or not it be in reality the general sense
of the nation that their rights have been arbitrarily
invaded....”</p>

<p class='c011'>Hope, indeed, springs eternal in the human breast;
otherwise people would not persist in giving such admirable,
such simple advice, seeing how little chance there
is that it will ever be adopted.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yesterday morning a man threw a bomb at the
Governor-General’s carriage, killing his <em>aide-de-camp</em>
and losing his own life, while the Governor-General
escaped miraculously. About an hour after the
explosion I went to the Hôtel Dresden with a naval
officer who was staying with me. It appeared that
the man who had thrown the bomb was disguised as a
naval officer; a man in such a costume is seldom seen
in Moscow, and is certain to attract attention. I and
my naval friend had already been to the hotel in the
morning; when we returned the hotel keeper said to us,
“You are suspected of having thrown the bomb.” It
was easy to prove that we were not guilty, owing
to the presence of the dead man who had done the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>deed. His naked body was lying in a house on one
side of the Square; he had a horrible wound in his
head. The attitude of the general public with regard to
the attempt was curious. When we got home, people
said to us, “Have you heard the news? What a pity
that two men were killed uselessly, and that the
Governor-General escaped!” They talked about it
exactly as if they had narrowly missed backing a
winner. Later I heard of two girls who quarrelled
because one of them said that she was sorry the <em>aide-de-camp</em>
had been killed. The lower classes do not
seem to pay the slightest attention to the matter. In
the middle classes people have lost all moral sense with
regard to these outrages. They consider that throwing
bombs is a kind of lynch-law; they do not distinguish
one individual from another, the honest from the dishonest,
the harmless from the guilty. But the people
who are to be blamed are those who, by bringing certain
things to pass, have created this feeling. When the
Government takes no notice of outrages committed on
the people, and allows the perpetrators to go scot
free, it is not to be wondered that the people are
“more than usual calm” when they hear that a
governor has been blown up. It is none the less
very demoralising for the present young generation
in Russia.</p>

<p class='c011'>Two men asked me for some money in the street this
morning because they had been drunk yesterday. I
went to the soldiers’ hospital in the afternoon, and was
much struck by the way in which the soldiers talked of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>the Duma. These men, during the epoch which had
followed the “Manifesto,” had been violently against
what they called the “Strikers.” They had told me
that when the procession attending Bauman’s funeral
had passed the windows of their hospital they would have
liked to have shot the dogs. Now they say that they
understand that had there been no strike there would
have been no Duma, and that on the Duma everything
depended. One man asked me how long the Duma
would last and when the first Parliament was made in
England. One of the soldiers asked me for books the
other day, and I bought him several of Scott’s novels.
He was so delighted with “Quentin Durward” that the
nurse told me he read all day and would not leave
his book for a moment. He told me the whole story of
“Quentin Durward” with the various conversations
between the characters.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>I had the good fortune to gain admission to the
Duma yesterday afternoon. I think it is the
most interesting sight I have ever seen. When you
arrive at the Tauris Palace, which outside has an
appearance of dignified stateliness, the stateliness of
the end of the Eighteenth Century, you walk through
a spacious front hall into what looks like a gigantic
white ball-room built in the late Louis XVI. style.
This is the lobby; beyond it is the Hall of the Duma
itself. In this long gallery members and visitors were
already flocking, walking up and down, talking, and
smoking cigarettes and throwing away the ashes and
the ends on the polished floor. One saw peasants in
their long black coats, some of them wearing military
medals and crosses; popes, Tartars, Poles, men in every
kind of dress except uniform. When the sitting began
I went up into the gallery. The Hall of the Duma
itself is likewise white, delicate in decoration, an
essentially gentlemanlike room. The sitting began
about three o’clock. The members go to their appointed
places, on which their cards are fixed, and the impression
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>of diversity of dress and type becomes still stronger and
more picturesque.</p>

<p class='c011'>You see dignified old men in frock coats, aggressively
democratic-looking “intelligents,” with long hair and
pince-nez, a Polish bishop dressed in purple, who looks
like the Pope; men without collars; members of the
proletariate, men in loose Russian shirts with belts; men
dressed by Davies or Poole, and men dressed in the
costume of two centuries ago. The President walked
in to his seat under the portrait of the Emperor, which is
a rather shiny study in blue and white. One thanked
Heaven the Duma had not been redecorated in the
<em>art nouveau</em> style, for almost all the modern buildings
in Russia, from Moscow to Kharbin, are built in the
mixture of Munich, Maple, and Japan which is called
<em>art nouveau</em> (modern style), and in Russia “decadent.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The President, C. A. Muromzev, strikes one as dignity
itself. He exercises his functions with perfect serenity
and absolute fairness. After reading congratulatory
telegrams from various parts of the Empire he proceeded
to read a motion proposed by a workman of
the Government of Moscow that before proceeding
further a telegram should be sent to the Emperor asking
for a general amnesty for political offenders, and
another motion asking for an immediate amnesty,
proposed by a peasant. A debate ensued. The
speeches were sensible and moderate. Most of the
members spoke against the motion, and it seemed
as if the matter was settled in the sense that the
question of amnesty would be dealt with in the Reply
to the Address and not before, when Professor Kovolievski
proposed a third course, that the President
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>of the Duma should inform the Emperor of the
unanimous desire of the Duma for a general amnesty.
What struck me most in the speeches I heard was
the naturalness of their tone, and the absence of
declamatory emphasis. Several of the speeches were
eloquent; only one was tedious. Professor Kovolievski
began speaking in his seat, and went on with his
speech quietly and in the most natural manner conceivable,
as he walked up to the tribune, where he
continued it, just as if he were engaged in a quiet talk
with a few intimate friends. A second thing which
struck me was the respect and the instantaneous
obedience shown to the President; when he called to
order by ringing his bell the silence was immediate and
complete. Soon after four o’clock there was an <i><span lang="fr">entr’acte</span></i>,
and the Duma proceeded to elect the thirty-three
members by whom the Reply to the Address is to be
drawn up. The members poured into the gallery, and
everywhere small groups collected discussing various
matters; some carried on their discussions in the
adjacent lobbies and rooms; many went to drink tea
or have some food in the dining-room, where the
accommodation is excellent.</p>

<p class='c011'>Many of the small groups where the discussion was
being carried on were interesting. One heard violent
ideas and wild words being bandied about. One
peasant said to a friend of mine: “When I look upon
this palace my blood boils; it was built out of the blood
and the sweat of the poor.” So it was. “Then you are
a person who nurses hatred?” said my friend. “Yes,”
he answered. “I hate, hate, hate the rich!” Another
man told a lady of my acquaintance that he was a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>Socialist. She asked him if he was in favour of the
land being made over to the State. He said, “No.”
He explained his views, which were really rather those
of an extreme Radical than of a Socialist, clearly and
with intelligence, and at the end she said to him, “But
you are not a Socialist?” “Yes, I am,” he answered;
and asked her who she was. She said that she was the
daughter of a Count who is a member of the Duma.
“I am very pleased to have spoken with a Countess,”
he answered, perfectly simply. I saw a big landed
proprietor, he came up to me and said, “This is very
amusing for you; but to me it is life and death.” After
the interval the sitting was continued. At 6.45 p.m. the
result of the election of the thirty-three members was
read out, and Professor Kovolievski’s motion was
debated shortly and rejected. After this the question
of closure was discussed and referred to a committee.
Then I left. The sitting came to an end shortly
afterwards.</p>

<p class='c011'>My impression of the whole is that the Duma is far
more moderate than I expected. I do not think, and
I never have thought, that the Cadet leaders are a set
of unpractical idealists or terrorists in disguise. Both
these ideas seem to me both to be <em>a priori</em> absurd,
and to be confuted by the facts. Supposing England
had been governed for years solely by the permanent
officials without any control whatsoever—and the only
difference that I have ever seen between Russian
officials and those of England or any other
country is that the Russian officials are uncontrolled,
and those of other countries are not—supposing that
there were in England a large party headed, let us
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>say, by men such as Mr. Haldane, Mr. Asquith,
Mr. Birrell, Mr. Balfour, Mr. Keir Hardie, Lord
Wemyss, and Lord Percy—I mix up Liberals and
Conservatives on purpose, because if in England there
were an autocracy, it is probable that all our Statesmen,
whether Liberal or Conservative, would be on the side of
the opposition—would not the officials and all their
supporters with one voice say that these men were not
practical men? The Cadets are not idealist professors
or men of letters or philosophers. They are educated
men, some of them learned and experienced lawyers,
some of them acute men of business, who in any other
country would unquestionably play a part in the
government of their country. In Russia (if they have
not been lawyers) they have been of necessity professors—if
they have wished to play any part in public life
save that of an official—because no other course has
been open to them. On the day of the opening of the
Duma I went to a Cadet meeting of one branch of the
party at Moscow, a branch representing one small part
of the town. The conduct of the meeting and the
character of the speeches were exactly on the level of
the best political meetings in other countries. A lawyer
made a most brilliant speech, based on the soundest
common sense. And I am certain that if any of our
leading political men had been present they would have
found nothing to criticise and much to praise.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of course, the question which is being anxiously
asked is whether the leaders of the Cadets will be able
to keep the more violent elements of their party in hand.
The violent element does not seem to me to be a very
large one. And I think that the future violence or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>moderation of the Duma will depend very largely on the
action of the higher authorities, and of what is at
present the official Government.</p>

<p class='c011'>Will the Emperor trust M. Muromzev, the President
of the Duma? If he does, the two together
will save the situation. Unfortunately, the impression
seems to be prevalent among higher circles in St. Petersburg
that the Cadets are revolutionaries, Jacobins, and
terrorists. If one has attended the Cadet meetings, where
they are among themselves and have no object in
concealing either their ideas or their tactics, one sees
that they are entirely separated from the Social
Revolutionary Party, which in its turn looks upon the
Cadets with contemptuous scorn.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yesterday a peasant said in his speech: “We hear it
said that we have millions of men behind us, and we
must demand, not ask; these high-sounding phrases are
all very well for a private meeting, but are out of place
in the Duma.” This was a very sensible thing to say;
but it is true, nevertheless, that the Duma has the whole
country behind it. Another peasant, speaking at a
small meeting a few days ago, said: “Russia has waited
for the Duma as the chosen people had waited for the
Messiah. Will they dare to crucify it? No, they will
not dare. For who would be the Pilate? The Emperor
will not be the Pilate, for, if he were to call for water in
which to wash his hands, he would have to wash his
hands, not in the waters of the Neva, but in the blood of
the whole Russian people.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Last night the second reading of the Address in reply
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>to the Speech from the Throne was passed by the Duma.
What will be the attitude of the Government with
regard to the demands which have been formulated?
As far as I have been able to gauge it, the attitude of
the supporters of the Government and of the more Conservative
element in the Council of Empire is this:
they say the demands of the Duma are impossible;
that the Duma is not a representative Duma; that no
notice must be paid to its extravagant and foolish talk;
that it must be allowed to talk on, and that Russia will
then see that its demands are preposterous. This I believe
to be the attitude of the Government. In support of
its contention that the Duma is not representative, it
alleges that Count Witte is to blame in having insisted
on suffrage by three degrees. Had there been universal
suffrage, they add, the Duma would have been more
Conservative. The day before yesterday I attended the
sitting of the Council of Empire, and during the interval
I had some conversation with some of the members, and
these were the kind of things I heard. Then I went to
the Duma and I talked to the peasants. I asked one of
them if he thought it was true that the Duma was not
representative and whether the opinions it expressed
were a faithful reflection of the opinion of the country.
He said that the opinion in the country was far stronger
than anything which had been expressed in the Duma.
I believe that he was perfectly right. One can only
judge by one’s personal experience, and wherever I have
been during the last month I have found the feeling
among the people dangerously tense and inexpressibly
vehement. I said to this peasant, who came from the
Government of Archangel: “Do they expect much of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>the Duma in your part of the country?” “They
expect nothing at all,” he answered, “because the
Government will never give the Duma what it wants,
and we shall have to disperse.” “And then?” I asked.
“Then we shall take what we want,” he said very calmly.
“There has always been a wall of bureaucracy between
us and the Emperor,” he continued, “and that wall is
still there.” Talking to other members I found that
they were just as little illusioned with regard to the
attitude of the Government as the peasant from Archangel.
One of them said to me: “Yes; it means there
will be a conflict.” Another said: “There is no connecting
link between us and the Emperor. We must
have a responsible Ministry, and it is on that point that
the struggle will be centred.” Another peasant said to
me: “We are not opposed to having two Houses; but
we are opposed to the Council of Empire as it now
stands, because half of it consists of the same Bureaucrats
who have been the cause of all our trouble.”</p>

<p class='c011'>I spent the whole of yesterday and most of the day
before in the Duma, and listened to a great many
speeches. The most salient fact about the sittings of
the Duma is their extreme orderliness. People say that
this is because the members are new to their business
and that the Duma will soon learn to be as disorderly
as the House of Commons. It is a fact, of course, that
the absence of conflict arising from the friction between
sharply-defined parties contributes to the general harmony.
But I doubt if the Duma will ever be a very
turbulent Parliament. Russians have a peculiar talent
for listening to public speaking. I have noticed this
constantly. I have sometimes wondered, for instance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>whether it was possible for a play to be hissed off the
stage in Russia just because it is tedious. A Russian
audience seems to me capable of listening patiently to
act after act of uneventful and colourless dialogue, to
things which would drive an Italian audience to frenzy
in five minutes, and would bore the British public into
throwing a dead cat on the stage. When they act
“Julius Cæsar” in Russia the scene in which Mark
Antony makes his speech loses half its effect by the
attitude of the crowd on the stage, who stand listening
in perfect silence, like moujiks listening to a sermon in
church.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yesterday the Duma sat from 11.30 a.m. until past
midnight, with a very short interval. The weather was
stiflingly hot, and yet the House listened to a series of
not very lively speeches, not only with decorous patience,
but with keen interest. The most striking orators
so far seem to be Professor Kovolievski, and MM.
Rodichev and Aladin, the first being remarkable for his
perfect naturalness, the second for his rather theatrical
eloquence, which, I confess, does not appeal to me
personally, but pleases most people, and the third for his
uncompromising directness of speech and powerful
driving force. There are others besides these, and
among them some of the peasants, who speak extremely
well. I asked a peasant who spoke best. He said:
“Rodichev spoke very well, and Jilkin (principal representative
of the peasant group) spoke well and quietly.”
I mentioned Aladin. “He is an angry speaker,” he
said. “He knows, but he ought to speak more gently.”
M. Aladin has spent many years in England, whither he
went as an immigrant. Mirabeau heard Robespierre
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>speak at the States-General (I think), and said: “That
young man will go very far, for he believes everything
he says.” I think this would apply to M. Aladin.</p>

<p class='c011'>I heard some one say to a peasant who came from
the South of Russia: “You should think of your common
interests; if each class only thinks of itself what
will happen? Do you think that one can be happy just
by possessing land?” Then, in the course of discussion
on the state of the peasants in Russia, he suddenly
asked: “How long ago is it since Christ died?” When
he was told he answered: “When will people begin to
be Christians?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Last night, when I was driving home from the Duma,
my cabman asked me many questions about it, and he
said that he had been a soldier himself and saw a great
deal of the soldiers here, and that if the Duma was
dispersed or came to nothing and the Government
attempted to exercise repressive measures they would
refuse to fight, because what applied to the peasants
applied to them. They were peasants, and the only
way in which their lot could be bettered was by the lot
of the peasants being bettered. “The Government,” he
added, “does not want things to go quietly.” It wants a
<em>bunt</em> (a rising), so that it can put it down by force and
then go on as before as in the good old days, but this
time it will not succeed, because the soldiers will refuse
to fire, and there will be a row such as there was at
Kronstadt, only on a far larger scale, and St. Petersburg
will be looted.</p>

<p class='c011'>This evening, as I was walking home to my lodgings,
I was attracted by signs of disturbance in a side street
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>off the Big Morskaia, where I live. I went to see what
was happening. A drunken soldier was lurching down
the street, making rude remarks to the passers-by. He
was arrested and with difficulty guided to the police
station, which happened to be in that street, by two
policemen.</p>

<p class='c011'>When they went into the police station a small crowd
of men, women, and children collected round the door,
which was guarded by a small boy of about twelve
years of age.</p>

<p class='c011'>A woman, with a shawl over her head, made an
indignant speech to the assembled public about the
arbitrariness of the police in arresting the poor soldiers.
“We know,” she said, “what goes on in there. They’re
beating him now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Shame!” cried the crowd, and made a move for the
door. But the unkempt little boy who was guarding it
said: “You can’t come in here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, we know you <em>dvorniks</em>” (door-keepers), said the
woman, “you are worse than the police.” “Yah!”
joined in the crowd, and a child said to the boy, with
inexpressible contempt, “Ugh! <em><span lang="de">Satrap</span>!</em> Police station
chicken!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then the crowd broke up.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>Every time I pay a fresh visit to the Duma I am
struck by the originality of the appearance of its
members. There is a Polish member who is dressed
in light blue tights, a short Eton jacket and Hessian
boots. He has curly hair, and looks exactly like the
hero of the “Cavalleria Rusticana.” There is a Polish
member who is dressed in a long white flannel coat
reaching to his knees, adorned with an intricate pattern
of dark crimson braid, and he also wears a long, soft,
brown sleeveless cloak hanging from his shoulders,
bordered with vermilion stripes. There are some
Socialists who wear no collars, and there is, of course,
every kind of head-dress you can conceive. The second,
and what is to me the principal impression of the
Duma, is the familiar ease with which the members
speak; some of them speak well, and some of them
speak badly, but they all speak as if they had spoken in
Parliament all their lives, without the slightest evidence
of nervousness or shyness. The sittings of the Duma
are like a meeting of acquaintances in a club or a <i><span lang="fr">café</span></i>.
There is nothing formal about them. The member
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>walks up to the tribune and sometimes has a short
conversation with the President before beginning his
speech. Sometimes when he is called to order he
indulges in a brief explanation. The last sitting I
attended they did their work in a most business-like
manner and got through it fairly quickly and without
many speeches. The peasants think there is too much
speaking altogether. One of them said to me, “There
are people here who have no right to be here.”
“Who?” I asked. “Popes, for instance,” he said.
“Why shouldn’t Popes be members?” I asked.
“Because they get 200 roubles a year,” he answered;
“what more can they want?” If this principle were
carried out in England there would be no members of
Parliament at all.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nobody can possibly say the Duma is disorderly; it
takes itself with profound seriousness. Only one person
has made a joke so far. But there have been many
dramatic moments; for instance, when the President
announced that he was not to be received by the
Emperor, and when for the first time, in breathless
silence, one of the Under Ministers spoke from the
Ministerial Bench. The beauty of the hall in which
the members sit is increased by its outlook, for the
windows form a semicircle behind the President’s chair
and they look out on a sheet of water and trees; a kind
of Watteau-Versailles landscape where <i><span lang="fr">fêtes galantes</span></i>
were once probably held. Two peasants cross-questioned
me narrowly the other day about England and
English Parliamentary institutions. They asked me if
there was an income tax in England, what sort of
education I had received, what was the state of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>agriculture in England, what was the rotation of the
crops (to which question I gave a vaguely complicated
answer), and how long the House of Commons had
existed.</p>

<p class='c011'>On Monday morning an amusing incident occurred
in the Lobby; on the notice-board a telegram from the
<cite>Temps</cite> was pinned, in which it was said that the
demands of the Duma were unreasonable. One of the
peasants strongly objected to this, and said that it
might influence the peasants. It was pointed out to
him that telegrams were posted in the House of
Commons and in all Parliaments. He then said,
“Why don’t they put up all the telegrams? Why do
they choose that telegram in particular? Besides, the
English House of Commons has existed for centuries;
our Parliament is being born, and to do that sort of
thing is like interfering with a woman when she is
giving birth to a child.” If it be urged that the
members of the Duma have spoken a great deal, I
should like to remind my readers that they have got
through a great deal of business in a short time. They
passed the rules with regard to closure and the Address
comparatively quickly, and they have now their
Agrarian Bill ready for discussion.</p>

<p class='c011'>Last Sunday I spent the afternoon at Peterhof, a
suburb of St. Petersburg, where the Emperor lives.
There in the park amidst the trees the splashing waterfalls
and the tall fountains, “les grands jets d’eau sveltes
parmi les marbres,” the lilac bushes, and the song of
many nightingales, the middle classes were enjoying
their Sunday afternoon and the music of a band. In
this beautiful and not inappropriate setting suddenly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>the Empress of Russia passed in an open carriage,
without any escort, looking as beautiful as a flower.
I could not help thinking of Marie Antoinette at the
Trianon, and I wondered whether three thousand
swords would leap from their scabbards on her behalf.</p>

<p class='c011'>One is repeatedly told by the best authorities that
it is a mistake to compare what is taking place
now in Russia with the French Revolution. It is, I
know, misleading, and yet I cannot help thinking
that, besides the fact of all revolutions having more
or less the same fundamental causes, and proceeding,
broadly speaking, on the same lines, there are certain
superficial resemblances of detail between the two
movements which are startling. What occurred in
Russia last year was, properly speaking, a prologue;
it was not comparable to the events of 1789, because
we had not in Russia yet reached the period which
corresponds to 1789. But now with the opening of
the Duma it seems to me that we are reaching this
point. This evening a Russian friend of mine asked
me to glance at a short manual of French history
which was lying on the table and to notice how striking
the resemblance is between the account of the opening
of the States-General and that of the Duma.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before discussing this point there is a greater and
more important resemblance to be noted, namely, that
the Constitutional Democrats or the Cadets are not
only playing the part, but are in their essence the same
thing, as the Tiers-État in France. The Constitutional
Democrats represent the whole of the educated middle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>class of Russia, and they are championing the rights
and the wishes of the peasants. It is, therefore, a case,
if ever, of saying like Sieyès: “<span lang="fr">Qu’est-ce que le Tiers-État?—La
nation. Qu’est-il?—Rien. Que doit-il être?—Tout.</span>”
Up to now the Tiers-État in Russia has
been politically nothing. In the future it will probably
be everything.</p>

<p class='c011'>What do the Cadets want? I find the answer in my
French history. “<span lang="fr">Établir l’unité politique et sociale de
la nation par l’égalité devant la loi et la garantir par la
liberté, c’était là, en deux mots, tout l’esprit de 1789.</span>”
That is also the whole spirit of 1906. People both in
Russia as well as abroad minimise the pretensions of
the Cadets because they are unaware of the existence,
or rather of the nature, of the middle class in Russia.
This is not surprising, because the middle class, besides
having been denied all access to political life, has
produced no startlingly great men in the branches of
production which obtain popular fame. The great
Russian writers and artists came nearly all from the
aristocracy or from the peasantry. Men who have
contributed much to modern science have abounded
in the middle class, but the fame of such men is rarely
popular. But now the work which the Cadets have
so far accomplished politically is a work which needs
not a few great men, but a compact mass of men who
are agreed.</p>

<p class='c011'>To go back to the French Revolution. It is striking
to read sentences such as the following, describing the
opening of the States-General: “<span lang="fr">Dès le 2 mai tous les
députés furent présentés au roi; le 4, ils se rendirent en
procession solennelle à l’église de Saint-Louis.... L’étiquette
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>avait assigné aux députés du Tiers un modeste
vêtement noir; ils furent couverts d’applaudissements.
Les habits brodés de la noblesse passèrent au milieu du
silence.... Le 5 mai s’ouvrirent les États.... Le roi
était sur son trône, entouré des princes du sang; sur les
degrés se tenait la cour. Le reste de la salle était
occupé par les trois ordres&#160;... le roi exprima, en
quelques nobles paroles, ses vœux pour le bonheur de
la nation, convia les États à travailler, en les engageant
à remédier aux maux, sans se laisser entraîner au désir
exagéré d’innovations, qui s’est emparé des esprits.</span>”
The powers which were conferred upon the States-General
were similar, both as regards their extent and
their limitations, to those of the Duma, and the spirit
in which they were given then was just the same
as that in which they have been given here. The
members of the States-General cheered the King.
And the silence with which the members of the Duma
met the Emperor recalls the phrase of the Bishop of
Chartres to the National Assembly, after the taking
of the Bastille, “Le silence du peuple est la leçon des
rois.” Unhappily the lesson is not generally learnt.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Duma worked hard last week to finish the
debate on the reply to the Speech from the Throne.
The third reading was passed at three o’clock in the
morning last Friday. It must be noted that the
majority of the Duma seem to have made a grievous
mistake in refusing to add a clause to their address
deprecating the murder of policemen by anarchists;
only five members of the Right supported this clause.
Later on Friday morning the President of the Chamber
asked for an audience of the Emperor, and it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>thought that no time would be lost in letting him
present the address, since all Russia was waiting
breathless for the event. Friday passed, Saturday
also, and Sunday, and conflicting rumours as to
the reception of the President by the Emperor were
continually spreading in the city.</p>

<p class='c011'>Late on Sunday night it became known that the
Emperor had refused to receive the President and
his deputation, and it was ordained that the address
should be presented through official channels. The
news was not believed at first. The blunder seemed
too great. Somebody had prophesied to me on
Sunday that such a course would be adopted, as a
joke, never dreaming that it would really be the case.
On Monday morning it was announced in the newspapers,
and when I arrived at the Duma, I found that
the place was in a state of agitation. “The Government
is defying us,” was the general expression.
An official remarked that the farce was over; that
the Duma would proceed to make a fool of itself by
some explosion of violence, and discredit itself for
ever. This did not occur. A short meeting of the
party was held in one of the Committee rooms, and
Professor Milioukov, in an eloquent speech, pointed
out the extreme folly of any policy of violence, and
his party agreed with him unanimously. This lasted
about three-quarters of an hour. Then the debate
opened; the President announced the intimation he
had received as regards his audience. M. Aladin
made a speech in which he gave expression to the
general resentment at the way in which the Duma
had been treated. Professor Kovolievski analysed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>the situation, and illustrated it with parallels from the
procedure of other countries, and then the House
went on to the business of the day with unruffled
serenity.</p>

<p class='c011'>Considering the intense bitterness of feeling created
by the action of the Emperor, the behaviour of the
Duma was miraculous in its good sense and moderation.
But the fact that this action was received quietly
does not wipe out its effect as an irreparable blunder.
The peasants were more incensed than all, even the
most conservative of the peasants. One of them said
to me: “The Emperor would not receive our delegates,”
in a tone of deep resentment, and this evening
the telegrams tell us that the feeling created in the
provinces where the news has arrived is alarmingly
bitter. It is a melancholy fact that if a course is
fatal it will probably be taken. I have begun to think
that the higher authorities here are destined to take
no single step which is not fatal. When one reads the
history of France, one understands people making
the mistakes they made, as they had not the glaring
example of the past before them; but it is hard to
imagine how people who have read the history of
France can persist in making the very same mistakes
over again. Probably the Government relies—and perhaps
rightly—on the troops when the inevitable
struggle comes. I asked a peasant member of the
Duma yesterday what he thought about that; he said
that he had talked with many soldiers, and that they
would refuse to fight if it was to be against the Duma.
The peasant may be mistaken; he may be cherishing
an illusion. But what is undeniable is the fact that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>the existence of the Duma entirely changes the situation
of the Army in the event of a great rising.
Because the soldiers now know that, if the Duma falls,
the struggle of the peasants for land and liberty is
lost, and the cause of peasants is their cause, because
they are peasants. In 1789 Paris was full of troops for
the purpose of keeping order. Paris was like an armed
camp. Eleven soldiers of the Guard were arrested in
July for their opinions. The National Assembly
demanded the dispersal of the troops, “<span lang="fr">dont la présence
irritait les esprits</span>,” and Mirabeau, commenting on the
line of conduct adopted by the advisers of the King,
put the following question: “<span lang="fr">Ont-ils observé par quel
funeste enchainement de circonstances les esprits les
plus sages sont jetés hors des limites de la modération,
et par quelle impulsion terrible un peuple enivré se
précipite vers des excès, dont la première idée l’eût fait
frémir?</span>”</p>

<p class='c011'>I was talking to-night with a very cultivated
Russian officer whom I had known in Manchuria,
who was a great admirer of Rudyard Kipling.
He said the “Jungle Book” was one of his favourite
books. He said he thought there was a certain kind
of Jingoism to which he considered it weak on Rudyard
Kipling’s part to stoop. He did not mean the
patriotism which inspired his work in the sense of
praise of England; but the passages which were
directed against other countries, such as France or
Russia. He cited the story “The Man that Was.” He
said he knew a true story of an Englishman made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>prisoner in the Crimean War. This Englishman had
been very ill during his captivity and was taken care of
by a Russian family. When peace was declared he
returned to England. Two years afterwards he died,
and his mother had been so touched by the way in
which he had been looked after by the Russians with
whom he had lived and by the way he had always
spoken of them, that she sent them a ring which had
belonged to him and a lock of his hair. He gave me
the names. He said he always wished to write and
tell Kipling about this.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>Events here are succeeding one another with
such rapidity that by the time what one has
written reaches England it is already out of date.
Yesterday was the most important day there has been
up to the present in the history of the Russian Parliament.
We had been more or less prepared by the
Press for the contents of the Address of the Prime
Minister to the Duma; nevertheless, its uncompromising
character, once it was revealed in black and white,
was of the nature of a shock, even to the pessimistic.
There are certain things in which one prefers not to
believe until one sees them. The strangers’ seats in the
Duma were crowded yesterday, some time before the
proceedings began at 2 p.m. The Ministers’ bench
was occupied. There was a feeling of suspense and
repressed excitement in the air. While the Prime
Minister was reading his declaration the silence was
breathless. One felt that a year ago the declaration
would have seemed an excellent one for an autocratic
Government to have made. But now, as the expression
of the views of a Constitutional Ministry, it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>like a slap in the face. One wondered, if these were
the views of the Government, why it had taken the
trouble to convene a Parliament. Ever since I have
been here I have always derived one and the same
impression from Government and Conservative circles:
that they do not seem to reflect that it follows, if you
convene a Parliament, that the result must be Parliamentary
government. Their ideal seems to be Parliamentary
institutions and autocratic Government. So
far, all attempts that have been made in the history of
the world to reconcile these two irreconcilable things
have met with failure. In no wise discouraged by the
example of the past, the Russian Government has
made a further attempt in this direction. It is to be
feared that it will be grievously disappointed, judging
from the reception with which the Ministerial declaration
was met yesterday afternoon.</p>

<p class='c011'>M. Nabokov spoke first. He spoke clearly and
calmly, without rhetoric or emphasis, and gave expression
to the universal feeling of bitter disappointment.
He was listened to in silence until he reached the question
of amnesty, and then, when he said that the House
considered this question to be one between itself and
the Crown, and did not admit the interference or mediation
of any third party with regard to it, the pent-up
excitement of the House found release in tumultuous
and prolonged applause. Likewise when he said that
the House regarded the declaration of the Ministry as
a direct challenge of defiance, and that they accepted
the challenge, he could not continue for some time
owing to the applause and the cheering. It was
admitted on all sides that M. Nabokov’s speech was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>dignified and masterly, and expressed what everybody
felt. He was followed by M. Rodichev, who indulged
in elaborate and effective rhetoric. Too elaborate and
too rhetorical, some people said; psychologically,
however, I think it was wise to let M. Rodichev’s
tempestuous rhetoric follow immediately after M. Nabokov’s
cool decisiveness; because when a body of people
finds itself in a tumultuous frame of mind, the tumult
must find expression. M. Rodichev’s speech reads
exceedingly well; and judging by its result it was
successful. M. Anikin spoke for the peasants, and
M. Aladin gave vent to the feelings of the more violent
members of the House. As an orator, he made a grave
mistake in pitching his key too high; he began at the
top of the pitch, so that when he wished to make a
crescendo he overstepped the limit, and the whole house
cried out “Enough! Enough!” After some moments
of disorder he was allowed to finish his speech.
The general impression was that he had gone too
far. He would be twenty times as effective as an
orator if he would curb his passion. The <i><span lang="ru">Novoe Vremya</span></i>
remarks to-day that it is said that M. Aladin’s oratory
is considered to be English in style. M. Aladin has
spent eight years in England.</p>

<p class='c011'>The most successful speech of the day, judging from
its reception, was that of Professor Kovolievski, who
pointed out that for the Government to speak of the
impossibility of expropriation was an insult to the
Emperor Alexander II., who had carried out the biggest
act of expropriation the world had ever seen. His
speech was at the same time extremely sensible and
passionately eloquent. He said, like Mirabeau of yore,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>that the Duma would not go until it was turned out
by force, and that in reminding the House that an act
of amnesty was the prerogative of the Crown, the
Ministry were, as a constitutional body, offending the
Monarch by giving the impression that should no
amnesty be given it was the Emperor’s will, and that
therefore not they, but the Emperor should insist on
their resignation. The House adjourned at 7.30, after
having passed their momentous vote of censure.</p>

<p class='c011'>The situation is, therefore, now an impossible one.
Matters have come to a complete deadlock. The
Emperor has promised by his Manifesto of October 17th,
and has ratified his promise in his Speech from the
Throne, that no laws shall be passed without the
consent of the Duma. The Government has made a
declaration that it will take legislation into its own
hands, and the Duma has replied by demanding its
immediate resignation. Therefore, the Government will
pass none of the Duma’s laws, and the Duma will have
nothing to do with the laws proposed by the Government.
What can be the way out of this situation?
The Government does not believe that the Duma is
representative of Russia. The Duma believes that it
is representative. The Government, I suppose, relies
on the troops. They say the troops can be depended
on for another two years.</p>

<p class='c011'>The following is the translation of a speech made by
a peasant deputy named Losev in the Duma on Saturday
last. It was the speech which was certainly the
most appreciated by the peasants:—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>“Until to-day I was moved by a feeling of deep joy.
I thought that the moment had come when the resurrection
day of our tired-out country would dawn. I
thought that the voice of our distressful country would
sound throughout the land, and would reach the ears of
our Monarch. He had said in his graciousness that it
was necessary to learn the needs of the country. I have
the good fortune to be a representative of the people.
Until to-day my heart felt joy. Now, I thought, we
shall do without that hour of ruin which threatens the
whole country; now, I thought, has come the happy
time when the worn-out and suffering eyes of the
peasant shall smile through his tears, the time which
shall see the bettering of his country and of his life,
when he shall no longer fear the threats of a Police
Government, when he shall no longer live in poverty
and famine. But now I will say that my joy was not
of long duration. To-day it disappeared. To-day from
this tribune I heard the terrible words pronounced by
the Prime Minister. In clear and brief words he said
that the solution of the land question proposed by
the Duma was altogether out of the question. What
did the Prime Minister pronounce to be out of the
question? The contentment of the starving country?
It is that Ministry in whose hands we are like
dumb animals. And that offended me deeply, and I
think that not I alone, but the whole country, was
offended.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was glad when I heard the answer to the speech
of our Sovereign the Emperor from the Throne about
the resurrection of the country. But I repeat that my
joy lasted only until to-day. To-day, my dears, I again
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>look upon our distressful country. She is once more
threatened by a menacing cloud of gold uniforms. We
see that a whole population, a hundred millions strong,
lies under the yoke of a few individuals and can do
nothing. Many express their sympathy for us on
paper, but nobody can help us. They tell us that the
fulfilment of our demands is impossible. I again put
myself in the company of the poor peasantry, who, it is
true, possess great strength. One can liken the peasantry
to Samson, who possessed exceeding strength. By
cunning they discovered what was the secret of his
strength, and bereft him of it. They took us, too, by
cunning, and by cunning they blinded us. I once more
repeat therefore that it is a duty not to play tricks with
a people a hundred million strong. When Samson felt
the power of all the mockery of the Philistines he then
said: ‘Lead me; let me uphold the columns which
support the building,’ and, taking hold of one pillar
with his right hand and one with his left, he said:
‘Perish, my soul, together with the Philistines!’ Who
forced him to do this? If wicked Dalila had not blinded
him, and had his strength not been impaired, he would
not have wished to do this. They made a laughingstock
of him, and he said: ‘Perish, my soul, together
with the Philistines!’ And then what? Those who
played with him perished beneath the crashing
building.</p>

<p class='c011'>“All the labouring peasantry is in even such a critical
situation. They treat it like a toy; but, my friends, I
cannot guarantee that the unhappy Samson will support
it. He will say: ‘Perish, my soul, with the
Philistines!’”</p>

      <div class='line'><em>June 20th.</em></div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p class='c011'>There are in the Duma thirty-five so-called “Moderates,”
a hundred and seventy-six Cadets, eighty-one
belonging to no party (mostly peasants, with one or
two independent gentlemen), about a hundred and
twenty belonging to the Extreme Left, who now call
themselves the Labour Party. Besides these there are
the Autonomists, consisting of twenty-six Poles, six
Lithuanians, four Esthonians, four Letts, two Ukraine,
and ten Musalmans. If we look into these parties we
see that the most prominent members of the Moderates
are Count Heyden, a Constitutional Monarchist, who
corresponds more or less to an English Whig, and has
all his life played a prominent part in the Liberal
movement, and especially in the Zemstvo meetings
last year, and M. A. Stachovitch, also a Constitutional
Monarchist, a member of the noblesse and a prominent
Zemstvoist and champion of the Liberal movement.</p>

<p class='c011'>Besides these two there are prominent men such as
Prince Volkonsky, also a Constitutional Monarchist.</p>

<p class='c011'>When people ask whether these men are capable of
managing State affairs, the question seems to me to be
rather this: Are they less or more capable of managing
affairs than a man like M. Durnovo?</p>

<p class='c011'>One of the most prominent members of the October
Party is M. D. Schipov, who was not elected to the Duma—a
Zemstvoist of great capacity.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now let us look at the Cadets. The practical
leader of the party is Professor Milioukov, the President
of the Union of Unions—the founder of the party
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>which he still directs. The Government excluded him
from the elections. But although he is not in the
Duma, he is a man of first-class ability, practical and
moderate; he possesses a complete grasp of the political
situation. His colleague, M. Hessen, a lawyer of great
ability, was also excluded from the elections.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the Duma itself we have M. C. A. Muromtseff:
Educated at Moscow and Göttingen, a professor of
law, he was obliged to abandon his professorship in
1864 and take to private practice. He is now the
President of the Duma, and there is not a dissentient
voice in Russia, from the Court downwards, as to the
superlative manner in which he fulfils his functions.
He combines suave urbanity with rigid firmness, and
has at present a complete hold over the Duma. M. I.
Petrunkevitch: “The father of the Zemstvo,” a strong
Constitutionalist; one of the best speakers in Duma, in
my opinion the best, and master of dry sarcasm. He
corresponds to an English Liberal member of the
House of Commons. M. F. F. Kokoshkin: A privatdocent
of Moscow University, a Constitutional expert.
His speeches are well composed and reasoned. M. V. D.
Nabokov: Son of an ex-Minister of Justice; an expert
in criminal law. He was dismissed from being <i><span lang="da">Kammerjunker</span></i>
for his opinions. He is an excellent Parliamentary
tactician and a good, clear speaker. M. F. I.
Rodichev: A barrister, of Iver; one of the most
prominent Zemstvoists; he presented to the Emperor
the famous address of the Zemstva at the beginning of
the reign asking for reforms, and received in answer the
command to put away these senseless dreams. He was
forbidden to live in St. Petersburg for two years. A
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>rhetorical speaker, rather like a rocket, sometimes bursting
into stars, at others falling flat like a stick. M. L.
Petrajitski: Professor of the Philosophy of Law. A
lawyer and a writer. He speaks the soundest common
sense; the temptation to listen to him can be resisted
easily. M. Hertzenstein: A Russianised Jew. Privatdocent
of Moscow University; took his degree in law;
and was employed in the Moscow Agrarian Bank. An
expert on financial and agrarian questions. M.N. Kareev:
A prominent historian. M. Vinaver: An authority on
civil law. M. N. N. Lvov: Educated in Switzerland, and
took his degree in jurisprudence; a Zemstvoist and a
large landed proprietor. Prince Dolgoroukov: The
bearer of a historic name. These are, I think, the
most prominent of the Cadets.</p>

<p class='c011'>Together with the Cadets there is another small
party who vote with the Cadets, called the Party of
Democratic Reform; it contains two of the most
capable men of the Duma. Professor Kovolievski:
A scholar and an unrivalled authority on Parliamentary
traditions. An eloquent speaker, who by
the charm of his personality has become the most
popular member of the Duma. M. B. V. Kousmin Karavaieff:
A Zemstvoist, educated at the Academy of
Military Law, at which he afterwards became a professor,
until he was obliged to resign in 1904. At the
request of General Kouropatkin he went to the war,
where he held a responsible position; he is one of the
best, if not the best, speaker in the Duma; quiet,
persuasive, logical, and eloquent. Prince Urussoff,
formerly employed in the Ministry of the Interior, also
belongs to this party.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>On the left is the Labour Party. M. Anikin: A village
teacher; a social revolutionary, opposed to violence; he
speaks eloquently. The abilities of this party seem to
me entirely destructive and in no way constructive.
M. Zhilkin: A peasant by extraction; subsequently a
journalist; a tall man with big features, light hair, and
spectacles. The tactical leader of his group. He speaks
well and clearly. M. Aladin: Of peasant extraction, but
educated at the University of Kazan, who emigrated to
England. A violent and talented speaker; too violent
to have influence in the Duma. His speeches are sometimes
interrupted by cries of “Enough.” One of the
most interesting revolutionary figures.</p>

<p class='c011'>The peasants either belong to no party at all or to the
Labour Party. Those who belong to no party consider
the Labour Party to be foolish. One of them said to me
that they were anxious to meet the proprietors halfway,
but the Government thwarted them by being so
uncompromising. A great many of these peasants are
exceedingly sensible. The Labour Party is utterly
and fundamentally opposed to the Cadets, whom it
despises. The situation of the Duma as regards the
Government, by which it is practically ignored, continues
to be abnormal; for this reason, and owing to
the fact that any active move on the part of the
Government unites the whole Duma in unanimity
against it, the creation of further parties is rendered
difficult. The level of speaking in the Duma is high; a
competent English Judge here says it is considerably
higher than the English level. Time has certainly been
wasted in talk; but the Right, and neither the Cadets
nor the Labour Party, have been to blame for this, and
also the abnormal situation of the Duma.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>As to the current of opinion outside the Duma. The
attitude of the Government, that the Duma is merely a
revolutionary meeting from which nothing serious can
be expected, is reflected in Conservative circles with
this difference: that, while holding this opinion, they
blame the Government for its action. Analogies with
past history may be misleading, but, however different
the revolutionary element here may be from that which
made the French Revolution, the Conservative element
here is startlingly like the Conservative element in
France in 1789.</p>

<p class='c011'>Professor Aulard writes as follows about Louis XVI.:
“<span lang="fr">Ce n’était pas un esprit supérieur. Les royalistes le
disaient bête, parce qu’ils le voyaient physiquement
épais&#160;... dormeur, mangeur,&#160;... mais il ne manquait
pas d’intelligence, et sa proclamation aux Français, qui
est bien son œuvre personnelle, offre une critique de la
Constitution de 1791 beaucoup plus fine que celle que,
de nos jours, Taine en a écrite. Voici en quoi son
intelligence fut inférieure à sa tâche: c’est qu’il ne
comprit pas qu’avec le système nouveau et le droit
populaire, il pouvait être un roi tout aussi puissant, tout
aussi glorieux, tout aussi roi, qu’avec le système ancien
et le droit divin.</span>”</p>

<p class='c011'>This last sentence explains the whole attitude of the
Conservatives here. They do not understand that if
you have constitutional institutions you must have a
constitutional Government. A man who calls himself a
Monarchical Liberal said to me the other day that the
Duma did not represent the majority of Russians, who
were moderate, and that the elections were to blame
because the Government had not taken the necessary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>steps to influence them in the right direction, as was
always done in other countries, including England. This
view, which is largely shared here, revealed to me the
truth of what some one else said to me not long ago:
that Russians of the upper classes here are often more
cultivated than the upper classes of other countries;
but they have no more idea of the nature of
constitutional government than the Turks.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the other hand you have the revolutionaries outside
the Duma, who have no real notion of constitutional
government either, attacking the Cadets with unbridled
violence every day, because they say that they are the
only bulwark against revolution. Therefore between
these two dismal extremes we have only the Cadets;
capable and well organised it is true; the question is,
How long can they remain masters of such a
situation?</p>

<p class='c011'>To-night I had a long talk with M. Aladin, the Radical
deputy. He gives me a totally different impression
from the usual Russian “Intelligent.” He has been Anglicised.
I don’t mean to say this has made him superior
to his countrymen, but it has made him different. He
complained of the want of practical energy among the
Russians. They had not got, he said, enough to satisfy
an English child.</p>

<p class='c011'>A friend was sitting with him—a musician, and at
one moment they compared pistols, when the musician
began gesticulating with a revolver. I felt nervous
because Russians are so careless with firearms. M. Aladin
said that in England there were precedents and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>prejudices about everything; here they were fighting in
order to establish their precedents and their prejudices.</p>

<p class='c011'>I asked him whether, since he knew England well, he
thought political liberty was really a great advantage,
and whether the great <i><span lang="fr">liberté de mœurs</span></i> enjoyed by
Russians did not compensate for the <i><span lang="la">habeas corpus</span></i>. He
said he wasn’t certain whether political liberty was
worth having, but he was convinced it was worth
fighting for.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nobody can possibly accuse this man either of
talking nonsense or of being a <i><span lang="fr">doctrinaire</span></i>, but he seems
to me a square peg in a round hole, as Kislitzki was in
the war.</p>

<p class='c011'>He does not seem to evaporate in talk. His manner
is mild, almost gentle, and you at once feel he has
unlimited energy. That is to say, he is just the opposite
of the ordinary “Intelligent” revolutionary, who is all

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>“The Duma is impossible,” said the Frenchman.</p>

<p class='c011'>“In what country of the world are people who
commit murder amnestied? And the land question—violent
measures such as the Cadets propose will ruin
the country. Agrarian reforms can only be gradual.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A young man who had lately joined the Cadet party
started to his feet. “You forget,” he said, “that we are
in the midst of a Revolution; that it is not a question
of what other countries do in times of peace and
prosperity. What is called amnesty here is called
justice in other countries, and as for doing things
gradually, it is too late. The Ministers come to the
Duma and speak of gradual reform. It is like telling
a person who has got appendicitis to go to the Riviera
and enjoy the sunshine. Matters have been brought to
such a pass that a drastic remedy is imperative. The
very people who preach to us now that prevention
is better than cure are those who during fifty years
refused to prevent.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“As for the amnesty question,” said the man who
belonged to no Party, “I refuse to discuss it. Both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>sides tire me with it. You,” he said, turning to the
Cadet, “with your hysterical bomb-throwers, and you,”
turning to the mild Conservative landlord, “with your
bungling police. The question of amnesty is absurd,
because very few criminals are in prison at all. The
bomb-throwers nearly always either get killed or escape
altogether. The mass of people who are in prison are
there by chance. They might be in the Duma; it is a
mere fluke. At Tambov the other day a clerk whom
I know of went to take steps about the raising of
his wages. He was arrested, together with the man
who drove him, and the son of that man. They have
been in prison ever since. No sort of accusation has
been brought against them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And don’t you call that a disgraceful state of
things?” said the young Cadet.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was thinking of the amnesty as it affects the
Government,” answered the man who belonged to no
Party, “and I repeat that as far as danger goes it
makes no difference one way or the other.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But as a question of principle it is impossible,” said
the Frenchman.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, impossible not to give it,” said the Cadet.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What do you think of the Cadets?” said the man
who belonged to no Party to the ex-official who
belonged to the landed gentry. “I could not vote for
them or against them,” he answered. “I feel with regard
to them exactly as I feel with regard to the Japanese;
the same combination of admiration and disgust. I
feel humiliated at recognising myself to be their
inferior, and proud at being in some respects their
superior. I believe that there is the same difference
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>between myself and a Cadet as there is between a
Mandarin and a Japanese. Perhaps the social value
of Chinese philosophy in not incomparable to the
French Eighteenth Century strain, which is still so
strong in us. At any rate, going back to the Cadets
and the Japanese, don’t you see a likeness between the
faculty of organisation that both of them possess, the
grasp of technical means, the near-sighted enthusiasm?
Parallels between the <em>ci-devant</em> Russian and the Chinese
have been worn threadbare. But now we are face to
face with the extraordinary situation of having, as it
were, Japanese and Chinamen in the same country
struggling for prevalence. This is why I could neither
vote for the Cadets nor against them. I feel that they
are a superior and at the same time an inferior race, to
whom one must leave the dirty business of governing
the country just as the Merovingian Kings did with the
Mayors of the Palace, reserving to themselves the faculty
of healing scrofula and the divine right of remaining
Kings.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t feel that,” said the man who belonged to no
Party; “the difference between us and all Europeans
and the Japanese seems to me to be a difference of
kind; they are as different from us as bees are different
from men. The difference between you and the Cadets
is merely a difference of class and of education.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I could get on perfectly well with the Cadets,” said
the ex-official, “just as I could get on with the clerks
who used to be in my office. If I were the Emperor
I would prefer a Cadet Government to a Conservative
one. But, for their weal or woe, Russia is not Cadet.
The Cadets can reform Russia if they choose just as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>Japanese can reform China. But just as the Japanese
will never make the Chinaman Japanese in character, so
the Cadets will never make Russia Cadet.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t agree with you,” said the Cadet. “The
same argument might have been used by an <i><span lang="fr">Intendant</span></i>
at the beginning of the French Revolution with regard
to the Tiers État. They no doubt said then that the
Tiers État represented nothing, because it had not been
allowed to represent anything up to that moment. The
same thing is true here. The Tiers État has been
suppressed politically, and owing to this suppression
it has burst out. It is far bigger than you think, because
all your minor mandarins and some of your major
mandarins belong to it and form part of it. Only
yesterday I heard a reactionary complaining bitterly
that all the officials in St. Petersburg sympathised with
the Cadets, which was scandalous considering that they
received Government wages. Besides this, the Cadets
include all the intellect of the country and all the most
intelligent men. They have partisans drawn from
every class.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I disagree with you,” said the man who belonged to
no Party to the ex-official, “on different grounds. I
believe the Cadets to be just as Russian as you are, in
the sense of being different from mere Westerners.
The other day a charming old Cadet gentleman whom
I know had some friends to dinner. They began
playing <em>windt</em> at nine o’clock in the evening and
they went on playing until eleven o’clock the next
morning without stopping. In what other country would
that happen? Certainly not in England or in France.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Grattez le Cadet et vous trouverez le Russe,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>answered the ex-official. “Perhaps if you scratch the
Japanese you will get at the Chinaman.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Surely not,” said the man who belonged to no
Party; “but apart from this the antagonism between
officialdom and the Tiers État is not a thing exclusively
Russian. It has happened in every country. The end
of the struggle is that officialdom or lawlessness is put
under control. That is what is happening here. Peter
the Great was the first Cadet, only he was self-sufficient
and had need of no Party.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There is a current of opinion which is hostile to the
Duma, and I have lately had the opportunity of seeing
manifestations of it. The views of the Ministry have
now been made plain to us and need no comment; but
one of the ideas which form the basis of their attitude
and their action is suggestive, namely, that Count Witte
is entirely responsible for the present state of things, in
not having introduced universal suffrage, which, if it had
been applied during the elections, say the Ministers,
would have produced a majority in the Duma infinitely
less Radical than the present one. I cannot help feeling
slightly amused when I hear this catchword solemnly
repeated, because when I was here before the elections
at Christmas time, the same people who repeat it used
equally solemnly to explain to me then the utter impossibility
and the terrible danger of universal suffrage.
Personally, I am convinced that whatever the system
of suffrage had been, the majority would have been
Radical, because the majority of the country is Radical.
That is to say, there is in the country a large majority
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>of discontented people. Nobody, I think, can refute
this proposition. It was confirmed to me the other day
by an intelligent Conservative. When I say Conservative,
I mean that he belongs to none of the Liberal
parties. He explained his point of view to me thus:
“I dislike the Cadets,” he said; “they inspire me with
a profound antipathy; I think they have played a
double game in their dealings with the Left; I think
they drew a line to the Right, and none to the Left;
that they promised more than they could give. They
said more in their propaganda than they now say in the
Duma. On the other hand, we have nothing better
than them. Besides them we have only the Government,
which is not worth mentioning, and the Extreme
Left, which is demented. Again, I think they really do
contain the most intelligent men we have got in
Russia now—the best brains, the best workers, and the
best organisers—and I could only hope for a peaceful
issue if the Emperor were to support them. I consider
them the sole bulwark against Anarchy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>I asked him what he thought of their attitude towards
the land question.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t think the land question can be settled by any
one project,” he answered, “because the conditions are
so different in various parts of Russia. The Cadets talk
of local committees and of the necessity of expropriation
in principle. I think what the peasants want is capital,
not land. When the agitation began my peasants
came to me and asked for five thousand dessiatines.
I offered them one thousand, and then they found that
five hundred was all they could manage to cultivate.
I think, of course, that all the land which is rented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>should be expropriated, and I think the folly of the
Government in ignoring the question of the land rented
to the peasants was supreme. The Government thinks it
can remedy the present evils by drastic means, but they
leave the cause of the evils untouched, which is this:
there is a mass of discontented people in Russia, and as
long as they remain discontented the disorder will continue.
There are some things which could be done at
once to render the peasants less discontented. They can
be given rights if they cannot be given land. They are
now at the mercy of the local magistrate.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The net result of this man’s opinion was that it is a
choice of evils, and the Cadets are the lesser evil.
Yesterday I had a talk with a man who bitterly attacked
the Cadets and all their ways. He was a member of the
Duma and belongs to the Left. He spoke in this
strain: “The Cadets insist on acting legally. It is
sheer cowardice. In times of revolution the only
effective action is illegal action. The Cadets have no
right to call themselves the Party of the freedom of the
people. They are nothing but Moderate Liberals.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But what do you think they ought to have done?”
I asked. “When the Government refuses to consider
our Bills,” he answered, “except according to a process
and after a space of time which they determine, we ought
to pass them in defiance of the Ministry and let them
dissolve us.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, supposing they don’t dissolve you?” I asked.
I don’t know what his answer was, because this conversation
took place in the lobby of the Duma, and the
spokesman, who was a Cossack member (not a man
with a shock of hair and golden sequins or silver braid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>on his coat, but a pale, thin, short man, with large
bright eyes and no collar), had such a fiery and emphatic
delivery that a large crowd collected round us, and one
of the crowd entered with him into a heated argument,
of which I heard fragments. “We have done nothing,”
he said. “We have been here a month and talked.”
“What else could we do?” said his interlocutor; “the
Government take no notice of us.”  “We ought to
declare ourselves a Constituent Assembly. The people
of St. Petersburg are like ducks who have been fired at.
They are afraid of the sight of blood. But the Government
needn’t think they have got the best of us, not those
silly little gramophones (this to his interlocutor) who
repeat what the Cadets say, but us, the representatives
of the people; we shall have a nice surprise for them.
We have got terrible means at our disposal without
even appealing to the people. That’s the worst of us
Russians: we know how to talk, how to write; they
translate our books into foreign languages; but we don’t
know how to act. I mean the educated Russians, the
Cadets; but we are going to show that we do know how
to act. Every day for the last month I have acted in a
certain direction.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The rest of the philippic was lost to me. One of the
arguers, who had just joined the Cadet Party, and being a
young official was frightfully proud of the fact, seemed
somewhat mortified at being called a “little gramophone.”
The temper of the Duma, although its outward behaviour
is decorous, seems to be rising in temperature. The
majority is in favour of moderation, and at present the
majority is powerful. The Government has been treating
the Duma like a spoilt child which needs humouring.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>There can be no doubt that the political atmosphere
has in the last two days become sultry.
The tension of feeling in the Duma has ominously
increased, and the feeling of the country has manifested
itself in increasing disorders. Even among the troops
mutinies have been reported from five different towns,
and the sailors at the various ports are said to be in a
dangerously excited state. It is now little more than
a month since the Duma met, and by looking back one
can judge to a certain degree of the effect its existence
has had on the nation at large. Some people say the
Duma has done nothing but talk. It seems to me it
would be rather difficult for a Parliament, especially a
new one, to pass measures of a complicated and
important nature in dumb show. Even the House of
Commons, after centuries of experience, has not arrived
at this. There are four Bills in committee at this
moment. The agrarian question is, it is true, being
discussed at length before the committee has drafted
the Bill. But it should be borne in mind that the
situation of the present Duma is abnormal. It proposes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>to elaborate measures based on certain principles
which the Government have declared to be
inadmissible.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Government morally deny the existence of the
Duma. A Minister goes so far as to request a newspaper
correspondent to state in the influential organ
he represents that the Parliament which has been
summoned by his Sovereign is no better than a revolutionary
meeting, and that it is the result of the
revolutionary machinations of his immediate predecessor
in office. Besides this, the official organ of the Government
publishes telegrams—which, even if they are not
(as there is strong reason to suppose) manufactured in
St. Petersburg or written to order by willing officials,
can only be representative of a small fraction of popular
opinion—inciting the population against the Duma, and
begging the Emperor to dissolve it. When one reads
these telegrams one is convinced that they cannot
represent a widely-spread opinion, for they run somewhat
after this fashion: “Great, unlimited autocrat,
listen to us true Russians, dissolve the herd of rebels,
who by means of Jewish money have usurped the
position of representatives of the people. Pay no
attention to their seditious cries, but listen rather to
us, whose only wish is that thy Heaven-given, anointed,
unlimited, multitudinous, incarnadined autocratitude
should remain unlimited. Give us less bread and
more taxes. We are perfectly contented. We have
everything our heart desires, so long as thou remainest
unlimited.”</p>

<p class='c011'>If the British Cabinet were to circulate among the
Army an invitation to destroy the House of Commons,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>full of insulting strictures on the members of the House,
we should not consider this action to be constitutional.
But this is what the Russian Government has been
doing during the last month. The situation of a
Parliament which has to deal with such a Ministry
is abnormal. What guarantee is there that the Ministry
will not dissolve it at any minute and change the
electoral law? Not, certainly, the fact that this would
be illegal and unconstitutional. Therefore, on these
grounds, and in these circumstances, it seems to me
that the action of the members of the Duma, in insisting
on having their “say out” on the land question
before anything else happens, is not so needless and not
such a waste of time as it at first appears to be. The
speeches of the members are reported in full, published
in the newspapers, and read all over the country,
and therefore if the Duma is dissolved suddenly the
country will be already acquainted with the opinions
and intentions of the Duma on the land question.
This is why the fact that the Duma has existed
and spoken out during a month is in itself one of
paramount importance and likely to be big with far-reaching
results. When the Duma met the Russian
people echoed the French poet’s cry that “une grande
espérance a traversé le monde,” but they were doubtful
as to its efficacy. Now that it has met during a whole
month, and that people within its walls have really been
able to speak their minds on burning topics without
being arrested, and have in no uncertain tones expressed
their opinion of the present Government, the effect has
been enormous.</p>

<p class='c011'>Last night I was driven home by a cabman who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>favoured me with his political views. I attach far
more importance to the views of any cabman in St.
Petersburg than to those of any of the Ministers,
because they are more intimately acquainted with
popular opinion. The cabman first expressed his
appreciation of the fact that some people in Russia
had too much land and others too little. Count
Ignatieff’s estate, he said, was a hundred versts long,
and he had eight estates. The Duma, he continued,
was demanding land and liberty. I objected that the
Duma might be dissolved. “They won’t dare,” he
replied. “But if they do dare?” I said. “Then we
shall kill them,” he answered. “Kill whom?” “Why,
all the rich.” “But will the soldiers be on your side?”
I asked. “The soldiers are peasants, too,” he said.
“But before they shot at the people,” I said. “Before
they did not understand what it was all about. Now
they know,” he said. “Go into any <em>tractir</em> (public-house)
you like,” he continued, “and you will hear
how the people are screaming.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Some weeks ago a change in the spirit of the Army,
owing to the existence of the Duma, was not improbable.
It appears to be now on the way towards
realisation. Some of the Guards regiments are said, on
the other hand, to be highly incensed against the Duma.
One of the peasant members told me that his brother,
who is in a regiment here, informed him that the
strictest surveillance was being exercised on the movements
and on the correspondence of the soldiers. He
said some of the regiments in St. Petersburg would be
for the Duma, but only the minority. I think it must
be difficult for people who have never been here, either
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>in the past or in the present, to realise that although
the old <i><span lang="fr">régime</span></i> has not yet been destroyed there is an
enormous difference in the general state of things
owing to the fact that up to last year the expression
of public opinion was impossible, and that now it is
not only re-echoed under the protection of the Duma
all over Russia but finds a vehicle in innumerable
newspapers and pamphlets, not one of which is without
what the Germans call a “Tendenz.” Every bit of
fiction, verse, satire, history, anecdote that is now
published is definitely and purposely revolutionary.
The non-political part of every newspaper is therefore
practically devoted to politics. Every day, and twice
a day, the same string is sounded. Everything in
Russia now is tinged with one colour, and that colour
is bright red.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the following dialogue I have tried to formulate
the views of those who have no sympathy with the
Liberal movement in Russia:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“I would prefer to hold my tongue,” said the cosmopolitan
philosopher who had just arrived at St. Petersburg,
when he was asked for his opinion on the
political situation. “I do not want to have chairs
thrown at my head.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We never throw chairs,” said the ex-official. “Either
bombs or nothing. But before you say it I know what
you are going to say. There are two classes of people
in the world: Liberals and Conservatives, if you like,
and there is also a third class. The third class consists
of what I call recalcitrant Liberals; they become Conservative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>not because they are Conservative by nature
but because they dislike Liberals and enjoy disagreeing
with them; but say what you think and confirm the
truth of my diagnosis.”  “I will,” said the philosopher,
“only don’t throw chairs at my head. All that is going
on in Europe at present seems to me to be contained in
the formula: Liberty is the tyranny of the rabble.
The equation may work itself out more or less quickly,
but it is bound to triumph. And as intelligent people
favour liberty I have gone over to the side of the idiots.
They produced an opéra-bouffe in 1870, I think, called
‘Le trône d’Écosse, ou la difficulté de s’asseoir dessus.’
The title was pleasing, but the figure of the King of
Scotland was more delightful still. He was, I will not
say troubled, for it did not inconvenience him in the
least, but let us say characterised, by softening of the
brain in an advanced stage, and whatever might be going
on he quietly slept through it, only waking up now and
then to exclaim emphatically ‘Pas de concessions!’ I
entirely sympathise with him. I feel exactly like the
King of Scotland, and I don’t care a straw whether I
am right or wrong. Right or wrong concerns our
judging faculty, which is a poor affair at its best, if it
concerns anything at all. Siding in practice with one
party or another concerns our passions, our habits, our
tastes, and our private interests. If we have privileges
we are there to defend them and not to bother, like
clergymen and professors, whether they are right or
wrong. We may be beaten; at least let us be beaten
fighting. <span lang="fr">Vive la réaction!</span>” “That is a point of view
I can understand,” said the man who belonged to no
Party, “but let us ask our friend (he pointed to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>ex-official) who, although often accused by his friends
of having regicide principles, has never been insulted by
being called a Liberal, whether he feels like that with
regard to Russia now.”  “Yes,” answered the philosopher,
“please tell me if you think my formula applies
to the present situation, and whether you agree?”
“Let me start by saying that I entirely agree with your
formula,” said the ex-official; “at least I did until a fortnight
ago, when I realised (I was staying at the Savoy
Hotel in London) that I had become (like Kips at the
Grand Hotel) a Socialist. My conversion, however, is
so recent and I have spent so many years in deriding
Socialism that I can, without any difficulty, speak from
my ancient standpoint. Well, I think your formula,
with which I so deeply sympathise, is not applicable to
Russia at present. At least it is applicable, if you
choose to apply it, but it is as far removed from what
I feel as the diametrically opposed view of the English
Liberal Press. I do not regard the existing struggle as
being one between aristocratic and democratic principles.
It is the struggle between one half of the middle
class, the Mandarins, with the Government and the
higher Mandarins at their head, and the other half,
the professors, the doctors, the lawyers. Above this
struggle the aristocracy floats as a nebulous mist, like
the gods when they returned to the Twilight of Valhalla,
and beneath it the proletariate and the peasantry
have been roused from their slumbers by the noise of
the fight. My point of view is very simple. I believe,
as a statesman once said, that the Russian Government
is an autocracy tempered by assassination. I hope that
the professors will, with the help of the peasantry and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>the proletariate, create a big enough disturbance to
destroy the existing Government and prepare the way
for a real autocracy. Then, and not until then, I shall
cry ‘<span lang="fr">Vive la réaction!</span>’ According to you I ought to
die fighting for my higher Mandarins; but you admit it
is only a question of one’s passions; well, my passions
are turned against them. I hate them. Of course I
would have fought for Louis XVIII. or Charles II.;
but I should have drawn the line at Charles X., and I
should have been rewarded by the result of the subsequent
revolution.” “I don’t think you either of you
realise,” said the man who belonged to no Party, “that
just as the battle of Valmy (which didn’t seem very
important to contemporaries except to Goethe, who
realised what had happened in a flash) was the beginning
of a new age, so was the universal strike here in
October last the beginning of another. I think all your
talk about autocrats, &#38;c., is amusing, but so very old-fashioned.
I don’t think there will ever be such things—again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But there are such things,” said the ex-official.
“Mr. Balfour ruled England far more despotically than
the most unlimited autocrat.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, but that is the kind of thing which I believe is
on the eve of disappearance,” said the man who belonged
to no Party. “I believe, and of course the wish is not
only father to the thought—but I wish hard in order
that the thought may come true—I believe that we are
on the eve of a social revolution, and that besides this
Russia will split up into separate parts. I hope this will
happen. Had I been an Englishman, I should have
been a little Englander with a vengeance. I should like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>to go back to the Heptarchy. I admire the England of
Shakespeare and Drake, which was little, more than the
England of Kipling and Rhodes, which is big. I admire
the Germany of Goethe and Beethoven more than the
Germany of William II.—and whom? There is no one
else to mention. The same with Russia. All that we
have derived from ideals of expansion has ended in
disaster. If we split up, who knows what the Duchy of
Transbaikalia and the Kingdom of Kalouga, for instance,
and the Republic of Morshansk may not produce?”
“But,” said the philosopher, “what will happen if the
power falls into the hands of angry demagogues of the
Extreme Left? What if they behave as the Convention
behaved, and, more reasonably, what if you have
all the tyranny of a Convention and none of the terror?
All the inconvenience and none of the excitement? In
Russia you boast of the <i><span lang="fr">liberté de mœurs</span></i> you enjoy;
don’t you think you run a risk of losing it?” “It is
true, of course,” said the man who belonged to no Party,
“that we run a risk of losing it, but I have a great faith
in the invincible plasticity of the Russian character.
And liberty of manners seems to me to depend on
national characteristics and not on national institutions.
You can prove, of course, that liberty of manners and
liberty of thought flourish abundantly under autocratic
<i><span lang="fr">régimes</span></i> such as those of Nero and Nicholas II., but does
it necessarily follow that it cannot exist under lawful
and disciplined administration? Ancient Greece and
Modern England are two cases in point where personal
liberty such as that which we enjoy in Russia is nonexistent.
‘Il ne faut pas l’oublier,’ says Renan,
‘Athènes avait bel et bien l’inquisition.’ As to Anglo-Saxon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>countries there is no more amusing spectacle in
the world than that which is offered to us when a
member of the Slav race seeks refuge in Anglo-Saxon
countries burning with enthusiasm for the mothers of
freedom. Witness Maxim Gorky’s arrival in America.
He soon finds out that he is enclosed in a brick wall of
prohibitions, and perhaps he thinks with regret of his
native country, where, although he was not allowed to
insult his Monarch at a public meeting, he could do
exactly what he liked. The rigidity of conventions
in England seems to me to arise from the English
character, which is rigid and likes convention; but the
Russian character is not rigid; it is pliant and draws no
line anywhere. That is at once all its strength and all
its weakness. Whatever gets the upper hand in Russia,
be it a convention, a board of Socialists, or a committee
of peasants, I am convinced of one thing, that the
members of this Government will never dress for dinner
when they feel disinclined or go to bed before they wish
to do so.” “But,” said the philosopher, “if you possess
personal liberty why bother about the rest? After all,
free political institutions presuppose a certain amount
of order and discipline. If you are without this order
and discipline, and if you do not wish for the drawbacks
of order and discipline, why do you make a fuss to get
what can only exist by order and discipline?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If we had been properly governed,” said the
ex-official, “nobody would have thought about it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The two things are not incompatible,” said the man
who belonged to no Party. “You can have free political
institutions sufficiently ordered and disciplined,
and you can also have personal liberty. If these two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>things have never been combined before, we will be the
first people to combine them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>On Sunday last I went by train to a place called
Terrioki, in Finland, where a meeting was to be held by
the Labour Party of the Duma. The train was crowded
with people who looked more like holiday-makers than
political supporters of the Extreme Left—so crowded
that one had to stand up on the platform outside the
carriage throughout the journey. It is of no consequence
in Russia how many people there are in a train
or what they do. In England there is an impressive
warning in the railway carriages about being fined a
sum not exceeding forty shillings. In Russia there is
also a quantity of printed rules. The difference is this—in
England, if you infringed the rules, something
would be sure to happen. In Russia nobody pays the
slightest attention to any rule and nothing happens.
You are not fined a sum not exceeding forty shillings;
on the other hand, a young man not long ago, owing to
the habit he had acquired—a habit universally practised
by passengers on the line—of jumping out of the train
long before it had reached the station, slipped on the
step, and was nearly killed. This is a small instance of
what people mean when they allude to the personal
liberty prevalent in Russia. It is also an explanation
of the existence of the quantity of printed regulations
you see in Russia. The authorities print a
hundred rules in the hope that one of them may meet
with attention. None of them commands attention. I
will give another small instance. If a stranger to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>Europe came to Europe and to England and tried
to get into the House of Commons without a ticket
and without being acquainted with a member, he
would find it, I think, impossible to obtain admittance.
If he went to Russia he could, if he said nothing at all,
walk into the Duma without the slightest difficulty.
The whole secret of avoiding bothers in Russia is not to
bother people who do not wish to be bothered. If you
do what you wish to do quietly nobody interferes with
you. If you ask you will probably be told it is impossible—it
is in theory, but not in practice.</p>

<p class='c011'>But to go back to the political meeting in Finland.
After a journey of an hour and a quarter we arrived at
Terrioki. The crowd leapt from the train and immediately
unfurled red flags and sang the “Marseillaise.”
The crowd occupied the second line, and a policeman
observed that, as another train was coming in and
would occupy that line, it would be advisable if they
were to move on. “What, police even here in free
Finland?” somebody cried. “The police are elected
here by the people,” was the pacifying reply, and the
crowd moved on, formed into a procession six abreast,
and started marching to the gardens where the meeting
was to be held, singing the “Marseillaise” and other
songs all the way. The dust was so abundant that,
after marching with the procession for some time, I
took a cab and told the driver to take me to the
meeting. We drove off at a brisk speed past innumerable
wooden houses, villas, shops (where Finnish
knives and English tobacco are sold) into a wood.
After we had driven for twenty minutes I asked the
driver if we still had far to go. He turned round and,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>smiling, said in pidgin-Russian (he was a Finn), “Me
not know where you want go.” Then we turned back,
and, after a long search and much questioning of
passers-by, found the garden, into which one was admitted
by ticket. (Here, again, any one could get in.)
In a large grassy and green garden, shady with many
trees, a kind of wooden semicircular proscenium had
been erected, and in one part of it was a low and exiguous
platform not more spacious than a table. On the proscenium
the red flags were hung. In front of the table
there were a few benches, but the greater part of the
public stood and formed a large crowd. The inhabitants
of the villas were here in large numbers; there were not
many workmen, but a number of students and various
other members of the “Intelligenzia”; young men with
undisciplined hair and young ladies in large <em>art nouveau</em>
hats and <i><span lang="de">Reformkleider</span></i>. (I wonder whether this last mentioned
garment has penetrated to London.) M.
Jilkin, the leader of the Labour Party in the Duma,
took the chair.</p>

<p class='c011'>The meeting was opened by a man who laid stress
on the necessity of a Constituent Assembly. The
speeches succeeded one another. Students climbed up
into the pine-trees and on the roof of the proscenium.
Others lay on the grass behind the crowd. “Land and
Liberty” was the burden of the speeches. There was
nothing new or striking said. The hackneyed commonplaces
were rolled out one after another. Indignation,
threats, menaces, blood and thunder. And all the
time the sun shone hotter and “all Nature looked
smiling and gay.” The audience applauded, but no
fierceness of invective, no torrent of rhetoric managed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>to make the meeting a serious one. Nature is stronger
than speeches, and sunshine more potent than rant. It
is true the audience were enjoying themselves; but
they were enjoying the outing, and the speeches were
an agreeable incidental accompaniment; they enjoyed
the attacks on the powers that be, as the Bank-holiday
maker enjoys Aunt Sally at the seaside.
Some Finns spoke in Russian and Finnish, and then
M. Aladin, the prominent member of the Duma, made
a real speech. As he rose he met with an ovation.
M. Aladin is of peasant extraction. He passed through
the University in Russia, emigrated to London, was a
dock labourer, a printer’s devil, a journalist, an electrical
engineer, a teacher of Russian; he speaks French and
German perfectly, and English so well that he speaks
Russian with a London accent. M. Aladin has, as I
have said, a great contempt for the methods of the
Russian revolutionaries, and he expressed something of it
on this occasion. He said that only people without any
stuff in them would demand a Constituent Assembly.
“You don’t demand a Constituent Assembly, you
constitute it,” he said. “It was humiliating,” he continued,
“that citizens of a big country like Russia should
be obliged to come to Finland in order to speak their
minds freely. It was time to cease being a people of
slaves, and time to be a revolutionary people. The
Russian people would never be free until they showed
by their acts that they meant to be free.” M. Aladin
speaks without any gesticulation. He is a dark, shortish
man, with a small moustache and grey serious eyes,
short hair, and a great command of incisive mordant
language. His oratory is, as I have said before,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>English in style. On this occasion it was particularly
nervous and pithy. He did not, however, succeed in
turning that audience of holiday-makers into a revolutionary
meeting. The inhabitants of the villas clapped.
The young ladies in large hats chortled with delight. It
was a glorious picnic; an ecstatic game of Aunt Sally.
And when the interval came the public rushed to the
restaurants. There was one on the sea-shore, with
a military band playing. There was a beach and a pier
and boats and bathers. Here was the true inwardness
of the meeting. Many people remained on the beach
for the rest of the afternoon. The Social Democrats
who had been present were displeased with M. Aladin’s
speech. Groups formed in the garden. People lay
down on the grass, and political discussions were held
by recumbent speakers. When they reached a certain
pitch of excitement they knelt.</p>

<p class='c011'>Two men attracted my attention by the heated
argument in which they were engaged, kneeling
opposite each other in a circle of recumbent listeners.
Presently a bell rang and the meeting was resumed.
I said to one of the arguers: “Why do you all quarrel
so much? You are disunited, and there is only one
Government.” He took me aside and explained
his views. He was a tall, bearded, intelligent-looking
man, a native of the Urals; he had been a soldier and an
engineer, and had had to leave the country for his
opinions. He had educated himself in France, Germany,
and Belgium, and had attended a Labour
Congress in London. He was a Social Democrat. He
said this meeting was absurd. “You see the real workmen
can’t come to a meeting like this; it’s too expensive.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>I was disappointed in Aladin’s speech. I think he is
unfair in blaming us for being feeble compared with the
French revolutionaries. The circumstances are different.
We have the proletariate here, and that important fact
makes a great difference.” I asked him if he thought
there would be a social revolution in Russia. He said
he thought Socialism must be adopted by all countries
at the same moment. He thought that the Russian
people were less capable of introducing it than any
people. “When these people talk the poverty of their
thought appals me,” he said. “And then the monotony
of the tragic note—never a gleam of humour; never
a touch of irony. Count Heyden is the only man in
the Duma who shows any signs of it. Look at our
Government, they lay themselves open to ridicule. By
ridicule one can pulverise them; nobody thinks of doing
it, and the strain of this long-drawn-out tragic emphasis
is intolerable. Yes, I was disappointed in Aladin. But
the first time I saw him I was convinced that he would
play a part in the Russian Revolution. It is a good
thing that such men should be. Gapon, however much
we may blame him, played a great part.” I found he
thoroughly disbelieved in the Cadets and believed only
in the proletariate. Later on other speeches were made
denouncing the Cadets and the foreign loan, and a
resolution was passed repudiating it. The meeting
went on till past seven o’clock, and then the mass of
people returned to St. Petersburg, having thoroughly
enjoyed their picnic.</p>

<p class='c011'>I went to the Duma yesterday afternoon and heard
some of the speeches of the much-abused Cadets. It
was like listening to Mr. Asquith and Mr. Haldane
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>after a dose of Hyde Park oratory. But because
people appear to one to talk nonsense that is no proof
that they will not get the upper hand. “<span lang="fr">Vous êtes
des verbiageurs</span>,” said the Duc de Biron to the revolutionary
tribunal. They guillotined him nevertheless.
And Danton said that Robespierre was not capable
“<span lang="la">de faire cuire un œuf</span>.” Yet Robespierre played a
part in the Revolution.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>The speech made by Prince Urussoff last Friday in
reply to the Minister of the Interior is generally
considered here to be the most important utterance
which has as yet been made within the walls of the
Duma. Prince Urussoff occupied for a short period a
post in the Ministry of the Interior during the late
Ministry. His speech is not only important from the
fact of its being authoritative, and because it throws a
startlingly interesting light on some of the causes of the
Jewish massacres, but also because it reveals the evil
which is practically at the root of all the trouble in
Russia.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>Representatives of the People</span>,—I rise to
submit to your consideration a few observations regarding
the question put to the Ministry by the
Duma and the answer to that question which we
have just heard. I presume that we are considering
the information respecting a printing-press concealed
in the recesses of the Police Department, by which
proclamations to the people are printed inciting them
to civil war, not so much in the light of a fact which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>belongs to the past and interests us only so far as the
responsibility of certain individuals is concerned, but
rather in the light of an alarming question as to a
possibility of the further participation of Government
officials in the preparation of those sanguinary tragedies
for which we have been notorious during a dismal epoch,
and which, as the events of the last few days have
shown, continue to occur, to the indignation of all
those to whom human life and the fair fame of the
Russian Empire are precious. Let me state at the
outset that I do not for a moment doubt of the sincerity
of the declaration made by the Minister of the Interior,
and that the words which I wish to say to you are not
directed against the Ministry.</p>

<p class='c011'>“On the contrary, the whole significance, the whole
interest, the whole importance of the question at issue
lie precisely in the fact that massacres and civil strife,
owing to the circumstances now obtaining, continue and
will continue, quite independently of the action taken
with regard to them by one Minister of the Interior or
another, or by one Ministry or another. With regard to
this point the declaration of the Minister of the Interior
does not seem to me convincing, and I will now try to
explain why, with this end in view, I must deal with the
question of the massacres, and try to unravel and explain
the part played in them by the printing-press which was
the subject of our question.</p>

<p class='c011'>“By a careful investigation of the massacres the
enquirer is brought face to face with certain
definite and isolated phenomena. First, the massacre
is always preceded by reports of its preparation, accompanied
by the issue of inflammatory proclamations,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>which are uniform both as regards subject-matter
and style. Secondly, when the massacre occurs, the
facts which are officially stated to be its cause invariably
prove to be false. Thirdly, the action of those who take
part in the massacre reveals a certain organisation,
which deprives it of all accidental and elemental
characteristics. Those who take part in the massacre
act in the consciousness of some right, in the consciousness
of impunity, and they only continue acting
till this consciousness is shaken; when that moment
arrives the massacre ceases swiftly and easily. Further,
in the action of the police there is never any uniformity,
and while certain police districts are devastated
by the massacres under the eyes of a considerable
constabulary force, others remain almost untouched
owing to the protection of the police, who perform
their duties conscientiously and energetically. Finally,
when the massacre is over, arrests are made, and
the authorities who examine the culprits cannot help
having the impression that those who have been brought
before them are less like criminals than ignorant
people who have been deceived by some definite thing.
Thus we feel that some kind of uniform and widely-planned
organisation exists. Those who affirm that it
is simply the doing of the Government, and think that
the question is thereby settled, are mistaken, but they
are not wholly mistaken; and the events of the past
winter, which form the subject of our question, will
help us to throw some light on these dark proceedings.
In January, 1905, a great quantity of well-printed proclamations,
which had been widely circulated in the
chief centres of Southern and Western Russia, together
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>with alarming complaints regarding the preparation of
massacres in Vilna, Bielostok, Kieff, &#38;c., came into the
hands of some one who occupied a subordinate position
in the Ministry of the Interior, and who was well known
as an enemy of massacres (I am not speaking of myself).</p>

<p class='c011'>“The massacre at Homel in January confirmed the
fears which had been expressed, and spurred the above-mentioned
individual to spare no efforts to prevent
further massacres, which he succeeded in doing owing
to the steps taken by the Prime Minister (Count Witte),
who gradually succeeded in discovering the working of
the hidden organisation. It was then that the following
facts concerning the action of the massacre-mongers
came to light. A group of persons, forming the active
militia of our own ‘patriotic’ societies, working together
with people closely related to a certain newspaper (<cite>The
Moscow Gazette</cite>) started an active anti-revolutionary
movement. Being ‘patriots’ in the sense recently
defined by the member for Tver and ‘full Russians,’
they discovered the cause of the revolution to lie in
the non-Russian races, in the inhabitants of the outlying
districts, and among the Jews. They called on
the Russian people, and especially the Russian soldiers,
to grapple with the rebels, in ten thousands of proclamations
of the most repulsive character. These
proclamations were transmitted by members of the
society to the place of action, and handed over there
to their local allies, who in their turn distributed them
with careful interpretations. The consequences, judged
from the point of view of those who were trying to
maintain central authority intact, were curious. The
assistant of the Chief of Police (I take an ordinary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>example) distributes the proclamation without informing
his chief. Or, for instance, the head of the first
police station would be confided in, but not the head of
the second. Special sums of money came into the
possession of some of the subordinates of the Gendarmerie;
certain obscure persons began to visit them;
rumours circulated in the town of certain preparations;
frightened people sought the Governor. The Governor
reassured them, feeling, however, that the situation was
far from reassuring. From the Ministry came telegrams
about measures to be taken, and measures were often
taken, but measures taken in this sense were far from
inspiring universal confidence.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It happened that members of the police supposed
in all good faith that such measures were taken for
show, for decency’s sake; but that they knew the real
object of the Government, they read between the lines,
and above the orders of the Governor they heard a
voice from afar in which they placed greater faith. In
a word the result was incredible confusion, utter disorganisation,
and the complete demoralisation of
authority. In the meantime in St. Petersburg, so far
back as the autumn of 1905 (and it appears up to the
time when the October Ministry took office), in No. 16,
Fontanka, in an out-of-the-way room of the Department
of Police, a printing-press was at work, bought
at the expense of the Department. An officer of the
gendarmerie in mufti, Komissaroff, worked the press,
and with the help of a few assistants prepared the
proclamation. The secret of the existence of this
printing-press was so well kept, and the doings of
its manager were so cleverly concealed, that not only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>in the Ministry but even in the Department of the Police,
there were few people who knew of its existence. In
the meantime the work of the organisation, of which
the press was the instrument, was evidently successful;
since Komissaroff, in answer to some one who stumbled
on it by chance and asked him a question about
the work, said: ‘We can arrange any massacre you
like; a massacre of ten or a massacre of ten thousand.’
Sir, this phrase is historical (Sensation.) I can add that
in Kiev a massacre of ten thousand had been arranged
to take place on February 3rd, but it was successfully
averted. (Great sensation.)</p>

<p class='c011'>“The Prime Minister (Count Witte) had, it is said, a
serious fit of nervous asthma when these facts were
communicated to him. He sent for Komissaroff, who
reported as to his actions and the authority which had
been given him, and in a few hours neither printing-press
nor proclamations were to be found in the
Department, and that is why nobody, not even the
Minister of the Interior, will be able to satisfy
the wish of the Duma to learn the names of the
men who created the organisation, assured its members
of immunity, acted like magic on the police and
other officials, and even managed to obtain promotion
and reward for the most active among them. I will
now proceed to my conclusions. My first is
this: That the declaration of the Minister of the
Interior affords us no serious guarantee with regard
to the cessation of organisations which take part in
the preparation of huge massacres and draw Government
officials into their sphere of action. It is clear
that the chief organisers and inspirers are outside the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>sphere of the Government, and as far as their business
is concerned it is equally indifferent to them whether
the Minister of the Interior will observe a benevolent
neutrality towards them or take a line of opposition.
Further, I affirm that no Ministry, even if it were
chosen from the Duma, could restore order in the
country so long as certain unknown persons who stand
outside, behind an impassable barrier, continue to lay
their brutal fingers on certain parts of the machine of
State, disturbing its political balance with experiments
on living organisations, and performing a kind of
political vivisection. My second conclusion is still
more melancholy—it concerns the Duma.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sirs, from all parts of Russia we have come hither
not only with complaints and indignation, but with a
keen thirst for action, for self-sacrifice and truth, with
true patriotism. There are many among us here whose
income depends on their property, and have we heard
from them one word against compulsory expropriation
of the land in the interests of the working man? And
is it not this very ‘revolutionary Duma’ which from
the first day of its activity up to the last few days has
attempted to raise the authority of the Crown, to
place it above party strife and above our errors, and
to preserve it from the responsibility for those errors?
What sort of a Duma is necessary now that the hour
of inevitable reform has struck, if not such a one in
which party interests and the class-division have given
way to the triumph of the union of the welfare of the
people and the welfare of the State? Nevertheless, we
feel that those dark forces are arming against us, and
dividing us from the Crown, and are preventing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>Crown from having confidence in us. They will not
allow us to accomplish that union with the Crown which,
according to the law granting us a new order of things,
is the indispensable condition and the only pledge of
the peaceful development of the life of our country.
Herein lies a great danger, and this danger will not
disappear so long as in the direction of affairs and in
the fortunes of our country we continue to feel the
influence of men who have the education of policemen
and sergeants, and are massacre-mongers on
principle.”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>After a week’s absence in England I returned to
St. Petersburg to find the situation much as
I had left it, except that the tension has perhaps
imperceptibly grown greater. The main factors of the
situation are unchanged.</p>

<p class='c011'>Rumours are current that a change of Ministry is
probable, but it is generally considered that the appointment
of a Ministry chosen from the Ministry itself is
out of the question. One fact should be borne in mind
in considering the rumours with regard to the latest
phase of Court opinion and Government policy, namely,
that there is probably no fixed policy in those spheres;
up to the present no such policy has been perceptible,
and what has been done one day has been countermanded
and contradicted the next. Therefore, as far
as the Government and the Court are concerned, all
things are possible. One might apply to them a phrase
used by a French historian with regard to Louis XVI.:
“<span lang="fr">Il n’eut que des velléités, des répugnances. Il céda
tour à tour, sans plan, sans dessein quelconque, aux
influences qui l’entouraient, à l’influence de la reine,
du Comte d’Artois, de Necker&#160;... il vécut au jour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>le jour, disant oui, disant non, selon que le conseiller
du moment était plus importun et plus pressant.</span>” This
is an exact definition of the policy manifested by the
Russian Government and Court combined during the
last two years.</p>

<p class='c011'>As far as the Duma is concerned, there is the same
deadlock which has existed ever since it met; the Duma
insisting on the creation of responsible Ministers, the
Ministers admitting the existence of the Duma in theory
and denying it in practice. The tension of feeling in
the Duma itself is greater than when I left, although the
debates of the last three days have been fairly quiet.
But it is a significant if not an ominous fact that the
Constitutional Democrats are now attacked by men who
have hitherto supported them on account of the mildness
of their tactics.</p>

<p class='c011'>A week spent in England enabled me to realise to a
certain extent what is the English opinion with regard
to Russian affairs. After one has been in Russia for
some time certain things become so familiar that one
takes for granted that they are too well known to
mention. If one then visits England one realizes
that there is a great gulf of ignorance between England
and the elementary facts of the situation in Russia.
I think the principal thing which struck me in what
I heard Englishmen say about the Duma was that
no sort of distinction was made among the elements of
which it is composed. It is generally supposed to be
a body exclusively consisting of violent Socialists. This
is not the case; although, owing to the abnormal
situation created by the Duma being face to face with a
Ministry which does not seriously admit its existence,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>it will at any moment be ready to show a unanimous
front of opposition towards the Government. The
second thing which struck me was that people in
England judge affairs in Russia according to an English
standard. They forget that the conditions are different.
The Russian Government, in some of its unofficial
utterances in the English Press, reminds us of this fact
when it wishes to lay stress on the opinion that the
Duma is not a Parliament, and must not be considered
as such. Their argument cuts both ways, and it might
be applied to the Russian Government, comparing it
with the Governments of other countries, but I would
rather apply this reasoning to the demands of the
Duma. The Government says these demands are impossible,
and public opinion in England is apt to
re-echo this sentiment, feeling that this standpoint is a
safe and sound one. I am not going into the question
in detail; only I wish to point out a few facts which
perhaps make these demands seem less extravagant
than they appear to be at first sight.</p>

<p class='c011'>Let us take first the abolition of capital punishment.
People say: “They are asking for the abolition of
capital punishment in Russia, whereas in an enlightened
country like ours we hang women. It is absurd.” Now,
capital punishment, except for regicides, was abolished
in Russia by the Empress Elizabeth in 1753; and
it has only been applied lately in virtue of martial
law. If you committed an ordinary murder in Russia
you were put in prison for a certain number of years, often
not for a very long period. Ordinary murders did not
increase in consequence, and the Russians were satisfied
with this detail of their legislation. Now, since the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>revolutionary movement began last year, and more
especially since the prevalence of martial law in many
districts, what has happened is this: that whereas capital
punishment was still in abeyance in respect to ordinary
criminals, it obtained as far as political offenders were concerned.
It is objected, of course, that people who throw
bombs must expect to be killed and that the murder of
innocent policemen is wholly unjustifiable. But the other
side rejoins as follows: “What is terrorism but the inevitable
result of the continued lawlessness of the local
authorities representing the Government?” While
admitting to the full that it is deplorable, how can one
expect it to diminish as long as the Government continues
to condone guilty officials, or only punishes them in a
ludicrously inadequate manner? It is here that the
Government’s case breaks down. A man who kills a
policeman is, if he is caught, at least certain of punishment,
but if a police officer walks into a house and kills,
as Ermolov did in Moscow, an utterly inoffensive
doctor, he is certain to be let off (Ermolov was
sentenced to deprivation of military rank and a short
term of imprisonment). That is what the Liberals
complain of, pointing at the same time to utterly indiscriminate
executions carried out under martial law by
generals in Moscow, in the Baltic provinces, and in
Siberia. I cannot say that I think their position is
wildly unreasonable. The Government’s argument is
exceedingly specious, and it is the easiest thing in the
world to convince any Englishman of its soundness,
only it omits half the truth and the whole cause of
the agitation.</p>

<p class='c011'>The same thing can be said about the demand for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>amnesty. People in England think that the Duma is
clamouring exclusively for the release of murderers.
The fact is that, as I have said before, the proportion
of murderers in prison is small. The bomb-throwers
nearly always escape or are killed, whereas the prisons
are packed with people who are there by chance and
against whom there is not even any accusation.</p>

<p class='c011'>Again, take the land question: the demands on the
Duma seem far less exaggerated to a Russian Conservative
than they do to an English Whig. The
Russian Conservative may, and probably does, disagree
with them, but he does not consider them childishly
outrageous. The Duma contains some highly-respected
and important landlords, who have all voted in favour
of the principle of compulsory expropriation, and I
think they know more about the land question in
Russia even than the most sensible Englishman.</p>

<p class='c011'>To-day in the Duma there was a barefooted man in
rags, who said he had arrived in St. Petersburg chiefly
owing to the kindness of the railway guards. His house
had been burnt, owing to some squabble with the police
authorities. Another correspondent and I had some
talk with him. He thought we were deputies. He said:
“Stand up for our rights and I will go back and tell
them you are doing so.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The question of the Inter-Parliamentary Congress to
be held in London is arousing interest here. It is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>yet decided what delegates are to go. Professor
Kovolievski introduced me to one of the peasant
members of the Duma—Nazarenko, the deputy for
Kharhov—who wished to speak to me about it.
Nazarenko is far the most remarkable of the peasant
deputies. He is a tall, striking figure, with black hair, a
pale face with prominent clearly-cut features, such as
Velasquez would have taken to paint a militant apostle.
He went through the course of primary education, and
by subsequently educating himself he has attained to an
unwonted degree of culture. Besides this he is a born
speaker and a most original character. “I want to go
to London,” he said, “so that the English may see a
real peasant and not a sham one, and so that I can tell
the English what we, the real people, think and feel
about them.” I said I was glad he was going. “I shan’t
go unless I am chosen by the others,” he answered.
“I have written my name down and asked, but I shan’t
ask twice. I never ask twice for anything. When I say
my prayers I only ask God once for a thing, and if it is
not granted I never ask again. So it’s not likely
I would ask my fellow-men twice for anything. I am
like that; I leave out that passage in the prayers about
being a miserable slave. I am not a miserable slave,
neither of man nor of heaven.” “That is what the
Church calls spiritual pride,” I answered. “I don’t
believe in all that,” he answered. “My religion is the
same as that of Tolstoi.” He then pointed to the ikon
which is in the lobby of the Duma. “I pay no attention
to that,” he said, “It is a board covered with gilt, but
a lot of people think that the ikon is God.”</p>

<p class='c011'>I asked him if he liked Tolstoi’s books. “Yes,” he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>answered. “His books are great, but his philosophy is
weak. It may be all right for mankind thousands of
years hence, but it is no use now. I have no friends,”
he continued. “Books are my friends. But lately my
house was burnt, and all my books with it. I have read
a lot, but I never had anybody to tell me what to read,
so I read without any system. I did not go to school
till I was thirteen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you like Dostoievski’s books?” “Yes; he
knows all about the human soul. When I see a man
going down hill I know exactly how it will happen and
what he is going through, and I could stop him because
I have read Dostoievski.” “Have you read translations
of any foreign books?” “Very few; some of
Zola’s books, but I don’t like them because he does not
really know the life he is describing. Some of Guy de
Maupassant’s stories I have read, but I do not like them
either, because I don’t want to know more about that
sort of people than I know already.” “Have you read
Shakespeare?” “Yes. There is nobody like him.
When you read a conversation of Shakespeare’s, when
one person is speaking you think he is right, and when
the next person answers him you think he is right.
He understands everybody. But I want to read
Spencer—Herbert Spencer. I have never been able to
get his works.” I promised to procure him Herbert
Spencer’s works.</p>

<p class='c011'>I hope he will go to London, for he is a
strangely picturesque figure and an original character,
this dark-eyed Velasquez-like Nazarenko, proud as
Lucifer and full of ideals, a kind of mixture of Shelley
and Cato.</p>

<p class='c011'>This afternoon I went to have tea with two of the
peasant deputies. They had asked me because it was
the Name-day of one of them. They are living in a
new hotel and are most comfortably lodged. They
pay a rouble a day for a room. Their rooms are far
more comfortable and much cleaner than mine. We
had beer, vodka, cucumbers, sardines and cold sausage,
and we discussed very many subjects. During the
afternoon many other members dropped in, and among
them a member of the “Council of Empire.” These
peasants, who come from an exceedingly distant government,
belong to the more educated category. I believe
the education in their particular government is good
owing to the energy the Zemstva have displayed there.
There are three of these peasants: one of them is
a sensible man who does not know much about things
outside Russia; but one of the others is quite well
acquainted with the main features of European politics
and talks of Jaurés, Chamberlain, and Lord Rosebery.
“Who would have thought two years ago,” said one of
them, “that we should see an Englishman here in the
flesh?”</p>

<p class='c011'>This evening I went to see an electro-technician,
whom I know. We went for a walk on the islands.
The technician’s brother, who had been a sailor, was with
us. The electro-technician had been in Belgium and
London. Then we went to the “Norodniu Dom,” the
“People’s Palace,” a place where there is a popular
theatre, a garden, and a restaurant. Before we went
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>in here, the technician’s brother said he must have
some vodka. So we went into a wine shop and he
drank a large tumbler of vodka straight off. “This
is the eighth glass I have had to-day,” he said. “It is
only habit. I don’t feel any effects from it; but if I
were to drink a glass of wine now I should be drunk.”
We went into the “People’s Palace” and sat in the
garden. Some other friends joined us. We ordered
beer, and the technician’s brother was unwise enough
to drink some. The technician described life in Paris
and London. Paris he detested. He spoke French
rather well. He said it was a boring city. I said, “Don’t
you like the French theatres? You must admit they act
well.” He said: “Their plays are so totally different
from ours that I cannot bear them. They are always
artificial and never the least like life. Our plays are
like life.” Talking of London, he said when he arrived
there he realised that the Continent was one thing and
England a totally different thing. He said he could not
understand thousands of poor people paying a shilling
to see a football match. He had lived in an English
family. He admired the neatness and the cleanliness of
everything. He thought the hospitality of the English
was great. He said the point of view of moral
superiority was extraordinary. The way an Englishwoman
he had known had spoken of Indians and Chinese
as something so infinitely inferior, too, had surprised
and amused him. The sailor brother put in a few
remarks and was contradicted. The glass of beer
which had followed the eighth tumbler of vodka now
took its effect, and he said that a man present had
morally spat three times in his face, and that he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>not going to stand it any longer. His brother said
that if he was not quiet he would go. He refused to
be quieted, and so the company broke up.</p>

<p class='c011'>To-day I went to the Duma with a translation
of Herbert Spencer for Nazarenko. I also took him
a translation of Shelley’s poems and a translation of
“Œdipus Rex.” “There,” I said, “are the poems of
a man called Shelley.” “You mean,” he answered,
“the man who was drowned.” He took up the
“Œdipus Rex,” and read three verses out of it.
“Modern poetry depends for its beauty on its
outward form,” he said. “It is all words; but if you
read two lines of ancient poetry like this you see
that it contains a whole philosophy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>I went to see Nazarenko in his house. He was not
at home, but a friend of his was there. He told me
to wait. He was a peasant thirty-nine years old,
rather bald, with a nice intelligent face. At first he
took no notice of me, and read aloud to himself out of
a book. Then he suddenly turned to me and asked
me who I was. I said I was an English correspondent.
He got up, shut the door, and begged me to stay.
“Do the English know the condition of the Russian
peasantry?” he asked. “They think we are wolves
and bears. Do I look like a wolf? Please say I am
not a wolf.” Then he ordered some tea and got a
bottle of beer. He asked me to tell him how labourers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>lived in England, what their houses were made of,
what the floors and walls were made of, how much
wages a labourer received, what was the price of meat,
whether they ate meat? Then he suddenly, to my
intense astonishment, put the following question
to me: “In England do they think that Jesus Christ was
a God or only a great man?” I asked him what he
thought. He said he thought He was a great man.
He said that the Russian people were very religious and
superstitious; they were deceived by the priests, who
threatened them with damnation. He asked me if I
could lend him an English bible. He wanted to see if
it was the same as a Russian bible. I said it was
exactly the same. He was immensely astonished.
“Do you mean to say,” he asked, “that there are all
those stories about Jonah and the whale and Joshua and
the moon?” I said “Yes.”  “I thought,” he said, “those
had been put in for us.” I tried to explain to him that
we were taught almost exactly the same doctrines,
the differences between the Anglican and the Orthodox
Church on points of dogma being infinitesimal. We
then talked of ghosts. He asked me if I believed in
ghosts. I said I did; he asked why. I gave various
reasons. He said he could believe in a kind of telepathy,
a kind of moral wireless telegraphy; but ghosts
were the invention of old women. He suddenly asked
me whether the earth was four thousand years old.
“Of course it’s older,” he said. “But that’s what
we are taught. We are taught nothing about geography
and geology. It is, of course, a fact that there is no
such thing as God,” he said; “because, if there is a
God He must be a just God; and as there is so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>much injustice in the world it is plain that a just
God does not exist.” I said I could conceive there being
an unjust God. Such an idea was inconceivable,
he said. “But you,” he went on, “an Englishman who
has never been deceived by officials, do you believe that
God exists?” (He thought that all ideas of religion
and God as taught to the Russian people were part of
a great official lie.) “I do,” I said. “Why?” he asked.
I asked him if he had read the book of Job. He
said he had. I said that when Job has everything taken
away from him, although he has done no wrong,
suddenly in the very depth of his misery he recognises
the existence of God in the immensity of nature, and
feels that his own soul is a part of a plan too vast
for him to conceive or to comprehend; in feeling that
he is a part of the scheme he acknowledges the
existence of God, and that is enough; he is able to
consent, and to console himself, although in dust and
ashes. That was, I said, what I thought one could feel.
He admitted the point of view, but he did not share it.
After we had had tea we went for a walk in some
gardens not far off, where there were various theatrical
performances going on. The audience amused me, it
applauded so rapturously and insisted on an encore,
whatever was played, and however it was played,
with such thunderous insistence. “Priests,” said
my friend, “base everything on the devil. There
is no devil. There was no fall of man. There
are no ghosts, no spirits, but there are millions and
millions of other inhabited worlds.”</p>

<p class='c011'>I left him late, when the performance was over. This
man, who was a member of the Duma for the government
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>of Jula, was called Petruckin. I looked up
his name in the list of members and found he had
been educated in the local church school of the
village of Kologrivo; that he had spent the whole
of his life in this village and had been engaged in
agriculture. That among the peasants he enjoyed
great popularity as being a clever and hard-working
man. He belonged to no party. He was not in the
least like the men of peasant origin who had
assimilated European culture. He was naturally
sensible and alert of mind.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Bill which the Duma passed last week abolishing
capital punishment was discussed in the Upper House
the day before yesterday and referred to a Committee.
As the treatment of this matter has excited no little
bewilderment abroad, it will, perhaps, not be useless to
go further into the history of capital punishment in
Russia, which I have mentioned in a previous letter.
Capital punishment was abolished in Russia by the
Empress Elizabeth, the daughter of Peter the Great,
in 1753. But as long as the knout was in use it
was rather the name of the thing than the thing
itself which was abolished, because a hundred lashes
of the knout meant death. During the last years
in which the knout was employed the number of lashes
was limited to thirty-five. Its use was abolished by the
Emperor Nicholas in the first year of his reign (1825).
Beating with a birch was abolished by the Emperor
Alexander II. in 1863, except for peasants; the beating
of peasants was abolished in 1904. “Depuis lors,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>writes M. Leroy-Beaulieu in his standard book on
Russia, “<span lang="fr">la législation Russe est probablement la plus
douce de l’Europe.... La peine capitale a depuis lors
été réellement supprimée; à l’inverse de ce qui se voit
en beaucoup d’autres pays, elle n’existe plus que pour les
crimes politiques, pour les attentats contre la vie du
Souverain ou la sûreté de l’État.</span>” During almost the
whole reign of Alexander II, from 1855 to 1876, only
one man was executed on the scaffold, namely Karakosof,
the perpetrator of the first attempt made on the
Emperor’s life. From 1866 to 1903 only 114 men suffered
the penalty of death throughout the whole of the
Russian Empire.</p>

<p class='c011'>Commenting on these statistics in the Council of
Empire, M. Tagantzef pointed out that, in contradistinction
to this, during 1906 up to the month of June,
that is, during five months, 108 people have been
condemned to death under martial law, and ninety have
been executed, not counting people who have been
killed without a trial. The cause, therefore, of the
present agitation is the fact that capital punishment
exists in Russia for political crimes only by virtue of
martial law. M. Leroy-Beaulieu, in commenting on the
first instances of this turn of affairs, which occurred in
1878, when a political agitator was executed in Odessa,
remarks that a modern State which abolishes capital
punishment should abolish it altogether, “<span lang="fr">pour ne point
se donner le démenti d’une contradiction rendue parfois
d’autant plus choquante pour la conscience publique
qu’il lui répugne de voir, comme en Russie, le régicide
ou le simple conspirateur politique traité plus sévèrement
que le parricide</span>.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>For and against the entire abolition of capital punishment
the chief arguments of each side are at present
these: Those who wish capital punishment to be
retained point to the number of political murders which
have occurred during the last year, and especially to the
long list of innocent policemen who have been murdered,
and maintain that if capital punishment is abolished
these crimes will increase. Those who wish it to be
abolished say that the existence of capital punishment,
so far from exercising a restraining influence on political
criminals, excites people to murder and makes martyrs
of them. Moreover, they point out that when people
expatiate on the terrible list of political assassinations
they altogether overlook their cause. They are not in
all cases the result of irresponsible hysteria. The
defenders of the Government say: “You make martyrs
of people who are merely common murderers;” the
opponents answer: “The Government shuts its eyes to
the lawless and criminal acts of its officials, and the
people are obliged to take the law into their own hands.”
This is the present state of the question, and I have
endeavoured to present both sides of it. Quite apart
from the political murders of the last two years, it is
interesting to note that, as far as we can tell, the abolition
of capital punishment in Russia has not had the
effect of increasing crime. In 1890 the proportion of
homicides was seven to the million in Russia (7·4),
almost exactly the same as the proportion in the
British Isles during that year, which was (7·5).</p>

<p class='c011'>This morning I went to see Nazarenko, who had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>made an appointment with me. My friend Petruckin
was there also. We discussed the question of the Inter-Parliamentary
Conference. He said he meant to go to
London. “They are so absorbed here in party politics,”
he said, “that they forget that these things are larger
and more important, because they concern Russia as a
great power. The members of the Duma do not want
to go with the members of the Council of Empire. But
I tell them it is like this. If I see a wounded man on
the ground and go to help him, and a man whom I
dislike comes to help him also, I don’t stop helping the
wounded man because the man I dislike is helping;
that would be absurd.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He said he had read some of the Shelley I had
given him. Shelley was a real poet. Russian poets
wrote about nothing except love; but in Shelley
there was a different spirit. “I have read Byron,
too, a long time ago; but he is too pessimistic, and
is always harping on one theme—himself.” I asked
him if he had ever read “Paradise Lost.”  “Yes,”
he answered, “I read it when I was thirteen; it was
one of the first books I ever read. There is glorious
fantasy!”</p>

<p class='c011'>To-day was a holiday and, talking of this, Nazarenko
said that the quantity of holidays in Russia proved
that the Russians were an inferior race. “My holidays
are those days when there is no work for me to do,
just as my fast days are those on which I am not
hungry.” Nazarenko, in the course of conversation,
said something about religion, and Petruckin broke
in, and said: “Take care! Mavriki Edouardovitch
(that was I) is a full believer.”</p>

<p class='c011'>During the last week not only were rumours circulating
to the effect that the resignation of the Ministry
had been accepted, but certain members of the Right
positively affirmed that a new Cabinet taken from the
Duma had been formed. It is said now that this task
was offered to M. Shipov, who is the most important
representative of the Moderate parties outside the
Duma, and that he refused it. Now, since yesterday
fresh rumours, which have had a bad effect on the
Bourse, are afloat to the effect that all idea of forming
a Ministry from the Duma itself has been abandoned,
and that the Government is contemplating the dissolution
of the Duma and the appointment of a military
dictatorship. Whether there is serious foundation for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>these rumours I do not know, but it is obvious that
there are only four courses open to the Government:</p>

<p class='c011'>1. To form a Coalition Ministry under some Liberal
leader outside the Duma.</p>

<p class='c011'>2. To form a Ministry from the majority of the
Duma.</p>

<p class='c011'>3. To dissolve the Duma.</p>

<p class='c011'>4. To do nothing.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Government is said to have tried the first course
and to have failed. The second course it appears to
regard as being out of the question. The third course
is said to be under consideration now. The fourth
course answers to the Government’s policy up to the
present.</p>

<p class='c011'>I have talked with several Conservatives lately—not
Moderate Liberals, but Conservatives of the old <i><span lang="fr">régime</span></i>—and
their indignation against the Government was
extreme. One of them said that the formation of a
Ministry from the majority of the Duma, namely, the
Cadets, with whom he had no sympathy, was the only
chance of saving the situation; that he could understand
the policy of dissolution; but the Government did neither
the one nor the other, and the people who were paying for
this mistake were the landlords with the destruction
and devastation of their property. Another said to me
that there were at present two great dangerous elements
in Russia—the revolutionaries and the Government—and
that of the two the Government was the more
dangerous. A third, a large landed proprietor, said that
he preferred to be despoiled by expropriation rather
than to have all his estates devastated and his houses
burnt. A Government taken from the majority of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>Duma, he added, was the only solution, but it should
have been done two months ago; now it was too late.
I mentioned the dissolution of the Duma and the
possibility of a dictatorship. “You would want five
hundred dictators, not one,” he answered, “and what
is the use of a dictatorship when the whole country is
on fire? The action of the Government has been like
this: it is as if some people had set a town on fire,
locked up the fire engines, and then talked of putting a
dictator at the head of the fire brigade.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In opposition to this I have heard views expressed
which perhaps reflect those of the Government. One
man said to me that it was now obvious that the
Duma, instead of having a pacifying influence, was
merely a cause of disorder; that when it was originally
convened he had believed in its pacifying capacities;
but now he was convinced of the contrary, and the
sooner it was dissolved the better. It may be objected
that, though it is after all true that the convening of
the Duma did not pacify the country, it is necessary to
reflect under what conditions it was convened: its
hands were tied; the fundamental laws were altered
for this purpose; the Government not only went on
governing as before, but actually took active measures
to discredit its new Parliament at home and abroad.
When a Duma was asked for, the thing meant was
Responsible Government. It is over this question
of responsibility that the whole struggle is being
carried on.</p>

<p class='c011'>I have also heard the following argument, which is
advanced by the newspaper <cite>Rossia</cite>, a semi-official
organ, this morning: “What do we lose by deciding on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>repressive measures? Even if we fail by giving in now
we should be failing; therefore we are exchanging
certain failure for problematic failure; it is better to
give in after a fight than to surrender without a
struggle, and our chances, now that we are certain of
at least one part of the Army, are better than they will
be a year hence, when we shall be certain of nothing.
We are told that we cannot dissolve the Duma without
provoking a revolution, but, from our point of view, to
give in to the Duma now is equivalent to sanctioning a
revolution. Let us try and prove that we can dissolve
the Duma, and that they are merely trying to bluff with
their threats of revolution.” The logical result of this
policy should be civil war.<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c019'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r3'>3</a>. And it has proved to be civil war; but civil war waged in
everyday life and unaccompanied by an armed rising.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>All the revolutionary elements in the country would
be strengthened by a dissolution, and one can safely
predict that the general disorder would be increased.
For even now the sporadic anarchy is increasing daily.
Will the dissolution of the Duma relieve this tension?
I think not. The question then suggests itself: Is there
no hope of a peaceful issue?</p>

<p class='c011'>A Ministry formed from the majority of the Duma is
the only hope; but whether it would manage to calm
matters is another question. It is true that there is a
moderate element, especially among the peasants, who
wish to meet the landlords halfway, who consider the
demands of the Extreme Left, and especially their
agrarian programme, to be absurd. These men would
support a Ministry taken from the Duma, but they continually
assert that the Government will not meet them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>half way, and that, on the other hand, they consider the
schemes which the Government have put forward to be
fundamentally insufficient. Whether a Ministry composed
of members taken from the majority of the Duma
would succeed in calming the country depends on the
nature and intensity of the opposition they would have
to encounter, which it is impossible to gauge at present.
One thing is certain, that in the event of such a Ministry
being given a free hand sympathy would cease to be
extended to the throwers of bombs, whose task is
now greatly facilitated by the simple fact that popular
opinion is with them.</p>

<p class='c011'>When people, on the other hand, say that the Cadets
have no men with whom to form a Ministry—and, to be
fair, I have only heard this argument advanced either in
England or by some Russian officials here—I have heard
it contradicted by intelligent Russian officials—they
are talking egregious nonsense. People like Professor
Miliukov, MM. Nabokor, Kokoskin, Muromtzeff, and
Petradjinski have shown themselves not only to be
men with brains but to possess political capacity and
tactical ability of no mean order. Even if they were
twenty times less capable than they are they would
be more capable of governing the country than the
present Ministry. But unfortunately it does not seem
probable that they will ever win the confidence of the
Crown, since most of them in the past have suffered for
their political principles, and some of them have been in
prison. Therefore, whereas if they had been born in
France or England they would by now be occupying
exalted positions, they are now looked upon from above
as men of the same category as Anarchists and throwers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>of vitriol. If Mr. Balfour had been born in Russia he
would certainly have been requested to confine his
energies to golf and metaphysics, but if Mr. Haldane
had been born here he would have probably been sent
to think about the path to reality in the paths of Transbaikalia.
Therefore at the root of the whole matter
there is a great misunderstanding between the Crown
and the Duma. It is based on the supposition that the
Duma is not representative, and that the revolution is
an artificial thing.</p>

<p class='c011'>To-day there are ominous rumours of dissolution in
the air. Nazarenko is not going to London. He said
he thought Professor Kovolievski was not going, so he
had withdrawn his candidature. Now it turned out that
Professor Kovolievski was going he was sorry. He
said he respected Maxime Maximovitch Kovolievski to

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>The dissolution of the Duma, although it had been
predicted during the course of last week, and
although the arrival of a large number of troops in
St. Petersburg was known, came as a surprise. During
the whole of yesterday the town was abnormally quiet.
I went to the various clubs: the Labour Party Club,
the Cadet Club, the Socialist Club. They were all
deserted. Some of the members had left for Finland;
others were holding meetings in various parts of the
town. In the club of the Labour Party, which is in the
Nevsky Prospect, nothing was left except the cold
remains of a supper, a large portrait of the Emperor, a
picture of the Dowager Empress, and a pastel of Spiridonovna.
At the Cadet Club I saw the peasant Nazarenko;
he was just starting for Finland. “Things are
bad,” I said. “The life of a State is like the life of a
man,” he replied, philosophically. “If there were no
bad there would be no good, either.” Other visitors
arrived and gathered together in knots, speaking with
bated breath, as if they were under the cloud of some
huge calamity. “Does it mean the end of the Monarchy?”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>I asked one man. “It means the end of the
dynasty, in any case,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the evening I saw some Octobrists and Conservatives,
and asked them their opinion. “The Government
may be right in having dissolved the Duma,” one of
them said, “but what is criminal on their part is the
way in which they treated the Duma from the first,
trying to discredit it in every possible way, and doing
everything they could to provoke it to rebellion.
Russia is an odd country, and everything is possible;
it is possible that the country may quiet down if liberal
reforms are at once put into practice; but I confess
I have little faith in this, and if the country does not
quiet down this Ministry will be directly responsible
for any disasters which may happen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Some one else, more Liberal, said to me: “If I lose
everything I possess, if my land is devastated and my
house is burnt, I shall never blame the Cadets; I shall
never cease to believe they might have managed things
if they had been empowered to do so early enough—that
is to say, last October.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A third person, a landlord, said to me yesterday that
the step was inevitable, because no Ministry, even were
it composed of geniuses, and no Duma, even were it
composed of angels, would be of the slightest avail
until it was settled whether or no there is to be
a new <i><span lang="fr">régime</span></i> in Russia. You cannot, he argued,
have the new wine in the old skins. It was no use
having a Duma supposed to be working together
with a power directly opposed to it and working in a
diametrically opposite direction. As matters were, a
law, if it passed through the Duma and the Council
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>of Empire, had to be sanctioned by the x quantity who
had the power in his hands at Court. And if it is said
that it is not constitutional to inquire into the advisers
of the Crown, it must be remembered that whenever in
other countries advisers have been all-powerful, and
have acted against the will of the people, the advisers
have been forced to go, failing which the Monarch has
been deposed. Now the question will be settled.
Either the Government will prove it can govern the
country and quiet it down—that is to say, it will prove
itself to be strong—or it will prove its weakness and
ultimately come to grief.</p>

<p class='c011'>All these are opinions I have heard expressed by
Russians during the last two days. I have also heard
it said that the dissolution of the Duma is an excellent
step, that the Duma did no good and some harm. I
have also heard all the disaster attributed to the Cadets,
some people saying they were too constitutional, and
that it is impossible to be constitutional during a revolution,
others that they did not succeed in dominating
the Left parties, but allowed themselves to be overridden
by them.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the meantime the new Prime Minister has
announced his intention of carrying out a great
Liberal programme of far-reaching reforms on a large
scale, and of maintaining the strictest order throughout
the country, so that the reforms may be realised.
This sounds charming. “At first, of course, you think
it’s charming, but very soon it gets alarming.” The
first step taken in the new direction has been to suppress
all the Moderate Liberal newspapers and to introduce
a system of censorship more severe than that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>which prevailed during the worst times of Plehve, and
to arrest a man who took off his hat to the members of
the Duma at the railway station. To-day, however,
the Cadet newspaper, the <em>Retch</em>, has once more made
its appearance. The Government are looking forward
to the new elections, which they hope will return a
Conservative majority truly representative of the
people.</p>

<p class='c011'>Among other constitutional matters there is one
lesson which they have not learnt, and probably never
will learn, and that is that if you have a Parliamentary
system you must put up with the fact that it will often
return a majority which is distasteful to you. If the
elections are carried out fairly it can safely be predicted
that the majority returned will be ultra-Radical. But
I suppose this time those steps will be taken which the
present Ministry so bitterly accuse Count Witte of
having omitted to take, the steps to “arrange” the
elections, which, we are told (several officials told me
personally), the Government always take in England.
That is to say, Mr. Balfour and Lord Lansdowne,
it is thought, take the necessary steps to prevent
the election of Mr. Keir Hardie and his supporters.
It is strange that so far this plan should have
proved unsuccessful. It would be, perhaps, simpler
here to pass an electoral law in virtue of which only
policemen could be elected members of Parliament.
This would prove a constitutional measure which the
present Ministry would thoroughly understand.</p>

<p class='c011'>One sometimes hears it said that the Duma was in
too great a hurry, and that it should have waited
patiently and obtained everything by constitutional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>means. This was the course the majority were doing
their best to pursue. They had to reckon with a
Government which was opposing them by unconstitutional
means. It is certainly not constitutional for
a Government to distribute among the troops
proclamations (I have seen them) inciting the Army
against the Parliament, and attacking members of Parliament
with every kind of gross insult and calumny.
Nor is it constitutional for a Minister to request the
correspondent of a large foreign newspaper to state
that the Parliament is not a thing to be reckoned with,
but merely a revolutionary body. The answer people
made to these objections is that there is not, and there
never has been, a constitution in Russia, and they are
perfectly right.</p>

<p class='c011'>But, apart from this, I agree with the Russian landlord
I have quoted above, who said that the main
question must be decided before one can talk of a
Parliament here. The abscess must be pierced to the
core, he said. It was a pleasing illusion to think the
Cadets would obtain a change of <i><span lang="fr">régime</span></i> by constitutional
means. “You must wait, little pigeon, you must
wait,” says a character in a novel by a famous Russian
satirist. “I have done nothing else during my whole
life,” is the reply. And if the Parliament had waited
until the Government became constitutional it could
have waited until Doomsday, because, as another Russian
said to me not long ago, “it has less idea of what <em>constitutional</em>
means than the Turks, only the Turks are
more competent and are better governed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Of course, if the new Prime Minister succeeds in
quieting the country and carrying out Liberal reforms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>on a large scale every one will admit that the Government
was right from the first, and that the Duma was
wrong. “But what use are reforms,” said some one
to-day, “when the Government has decided not to give
the initial reform which should be the cause of all the
others: namely, a change of <i><span lang="fr">régime</span></i>, a constitution and
a system of responsible government?” Besides, in order
to quiet the country the Government must first succeed
in recovering the confidence of the people. At present
it has not got the confidence of any party, any group,
or any section of the population.</p>

<p class='c011'>St. Petersburg is full of troops. A cabman said to
me yesterday that these were not Russian troops, but
<em>Austrians</em> in disguise. This is a curious reflection of
the remarks on foreign intervention which were published
on the first page of the semi-official newspaper
here last week, without, of course, the knowledge of the
Ministers. I asked the same man what he expected
would happen. “There will be a big <em>skandal</em>,” he
answered. “It is impossible that it should be otherwise.
They say: ‘Let us have a Duma,’ and then they
say, ‘Let us send it away’; there can only be disorders
after that. We, the cabmen, have never yet struck, but
we shall this time when the moment comes.” (I think
he thought that would make all the difference.) “What
about the soldiers?” I asked. “The soldiers oughtn’t
to rebel,” he answered, “but they ought to refuse to fire
on the people. They would not be breaking their oath.
Their oath obliges them to fight the enemy, but not
their brothers. That is wrong.” Another cabman said
a curious thing to me, as we were driving along the
Quays. “We of ourselves can do nothing,” he said;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>“but those are the people who will do it for us,” and he
pointed to a student who was passing by.</p>

<p class='c011'>The hall porter at the house where I lived told me he
had known it all along. “It is bad,” he said; “very
bad.” I think that is really all there is to be said about
the matter. It is bad; very bad—that is to say, if one
looks back and then forward.</p>

<p class='c011'>News has come of the appeal the ex-members of the
Duma have made to the country, urging citizens not to
pay taxes and to refuse to serve in the Army. Everybody
is agreed that their action is a fatal mistake, since
they have no means of having any such measures carried
out.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>I have been staying for the last three days in the
country quite close to Moscow. I thought I should
get away for a time from politics, from talk of new
Cabinets, new eras, liberal autocracy, strong-handed
reform, and other such pleasing illusions. I was mistaken.
Politics filter through everywhere now; in a
third-class railway carriage, at the station buffets, in the
public parks, in the villages.</p>

<p class='c011'>As regards the various opinions I heard expressed
the prevailing one is this: that the new Prime Minister’s
programme of strong-handed Liberal reform is a repetition
of the programme of the last five Ministers of the
Interior.</p>

<p class='c011'>M. Stolypin says these last five Premiers were all
mistaken in their policy; in the meantime (people say)
it is difficult to see in what respects his programme is to
differ from theirs. And we have no evidence as yet
that M. Stolypin is an infinitely more capable man than
Count Witte. Some people, referring to the official
denial of the article that appeared in the semi-official
newspaper <em>Rossia</em>, with regard to foreign intervention,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>say: “If M. Stolypin cannot control the first page of his
official newspaper, how can he expect to control Russia?”
Others commenting on his intention to initiate social
reform and put a stop to the political movement, say
that this effort is the very root and kernel of the whole
trouble in Russia; that the mistake of would-be
reformers has always consisted in their not understanding
that social reforms are impossible unless they are
preceded by political reforms. (M. Leroy-Beaulieu, in
his splendid book on Russia, writes in a most illuminating
fashion on this very point.)</p>

<p class='c011'>As regards what is actually happening in Moscow,
the town is empty and quiet; public meetings are forbidden,
small political gatherings in private houses are
held only under surveillance of the police; gatherings
of the “Black Gang” are said to be allowed; the Press
is certainly subjected to a rigid censorship; the <cite>Morning
Post</cite> arrived blacked out yesterday for the first time for
two years; the manifesto of the ex-members is being
spread, likewise the manifesto of the Social Democrats.
I have not seen anybody who thinks that an era of
peace and resigned content has begun.</p>

<p class='c011'>Near the house where I am living there is a village;
as this village is so close to the town of Moscow I
thought that its inhabitants would be suburban, and
therefore not representative of peasant life. This is not
so. The nearness to Moscow seems to make no difference
at all. I was walking through the village on
Saturday morning when a peasant who was sitting on his
doorstep called me and asked me if I would like to eat an
apple. I accepted his invitation. He said he presumed
I was living with X., as other Englishmen had lived
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>there before. Then he asked abruptly, “Is Marie
Alexandrovna in your place?” I said my hostess’s
name was Marie Karlovna. “Of course,” he said, “I
don’t mean here, but in your place, in your country.”
I didn’t understand. Then he said it again very loud,
and asked if I was deaf. I said I wasn’t deaf and that
I understood what he said, but I did not know to whom
he was alluding. “Talking to you,” he said, “is like
talking to a Tartar. You look at one and don’t understand
what one says.” Then it suddenly flashed on me
that he was alluding to the Queen of England. “You
mean Queen Alexandra,” I said, “the sister of the
Empress Marie Feodorovna.” “That’s what I mean,”
he said. It afterwards appeared that he considered that
England had been semi-Russianised owing to this
relationship; he thought of course that both the Queen
and the Empress were Russians.</p>

<p class='c011'>Two more peasants joined us, and one of them brought
a small bottle (the size of a sample) of vodka and a
plate of cherries. “We will go and drink this in the
orchard,” they said. So we went to the orchard. “You
have come here to learn,” said the first peasant, a
bearded man, whose name was Feodor. “Many
Englishmen have been here to learn. I taught one all
the words that we use.” I said I was a correspondent;
that I had just arrived from St. Petersburg, where I
had attended the sittings of the Duma. “What about
the Duma?” asked the other peasant. “They’ve sent
it away. Will there be another one?” I said a manifesto
spoke of a new one. “Yes,” said Feodor, “there
is a manifesto abolishing punishments.” I said I
hadn’t observed that clause. “Will they give us back
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>our land?” asked Feodor. “All the land here belongs
to us really.” Then followed a long explanation as to
why the land belonged to them. It is the property, as
a matter of fact, of the Crown. I said I did not know.
“If they don’t give it back to us we shall take it,” he
said simply. Then one of the other peasants added,
“Those manifestoes are not written by the Emperor but
by the ‘authorities.’” (The same thing was said to me
by a cabman at St. Petersburg, his reason being that
the Emperor would say “I,” whereas the manifesto said
“We.”) Then they asked me why they had not won
the war; and whether it was true that the war had been
badly managed. “We know nothing,” he said. “What
newspaper tells the truth? Where can we find the real
truth? Is it to be found in the <cite>Russkoe Slovo</cite>?” (a big
Moscow newspaper). They asked me about the Baltic
Fleet and why Admiral Nebogatoff had hoisted a signal
which meant “Beat us.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then I went away, and as I was going Feodor asked
me if I would like to go and see the haymaking the
next day. If so I had better be at his house at three
o’clock in the afternoon. The next day, Sunday, I kept
my appointment, but found nobody at home in the
house of Feodor except a small child. “Is Feodor at
home?” I asked. Then a man appeared from a neighbouring
cottage and said: “Feodor is in the inn—drunk.”
“Is he going to the haymaking?” I asked.
“Of course he’s going.” “Is he very drunk?” I asked.
“No, not very; I will tell him you are here.” And the
man went to fetch him. Then a third person arrived, a
young peasant in his Sunday clothes, and asked me
where I was going. I said I was going to make hay.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>“Do you know how to?” he asked. I said I didn’t.
“I see,” he said, “you are just going to amuse yourself.
I advise you not to go. They will be drunk, and there
might be unpleasantness.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Feodor arrived, apparently perfectly sober
except that he was rather red in the face. He harnessed
his horse to a cart. “Would I mind not wearing my
hat but one of his?” he asked. I said I didn’t mind, and
he lent me a dark blue yachting cap, which is what the
peasants wear all over Russia. My shirt was all right.
I had got on a loose Russian shirt without a collar. He
explained that it would look odd to be seen with some
one wearing such a hat as I had. It was a felt hat.
The little boy who was running about the house was
Feodor’s son. He was barefooted, and one of his feet
was bound up. I asked what was the matter with it.
The bandage was at once taken off and I was shown
the remains of a large blister and gathering. “It’s been
cured now,” Feodor said. “It was a huge blister. It
was cured by witchcraft. I took him to the Wise
Woman and she put something on it and said a few
words and the pain stopped, and it got quite well.
Doctors are no good; they only cut one about. I was
kicked by a horse and the pain was terrible. I drank a
lot of vodka and it did no good; then I went to the
Wise Woman and she put ointment on the place and
she spoke away the pain. We think it’s best to be cured
like this—village fashion.” I knew this practice existed,
but it was curious to find it so near Moscow. It was
like finding witchcraft at Surbiton.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then we started for the hay meadows, which were
about ten miles distant. On the road we met other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>peasants in carts bound for the same destination. They
all gravely took off their hats to each other. After an
hour and a half’s drive we arrived at the Moscow River,
on the bank of which there is a tea-shop. Tea-shops
exist all over Russia. The feature of them is that you
cannot buy spirits there. We stopped and had tea.
Everybody was brought a small teapot for tea and a
huge teapot of boiling water, and very small cups, and
everybody drank about four or five cups out of the
saucer. They eat the sugar separately, and do not put
it into the cup.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then we crossed the river on a floating bridge, and
driving past a large white Byzantine monastery arrived
at the green hay meadows on the farther river bank
towards sunset. Then the haymaking began. The
first step which was taken was for vodka bottles to be
produced and for everybody to drink vodka out of a
cup. Then there was a great deal of shouting and an
immense amount of abuse. “It doesn’t mean anything,”
Feodor said. “We curse each other and make it up
afterwards.” Then they drew lots for the particular
strip they should mow; each man carrying his scythe
high over his shoulder. (“Don’t come too near,” said
Feodor; “when men have taken drink they are careless
with scythes.”)</p>

<p class='c011'>When the lots were drawn they began mowing. It
was a beautiful sight to see the mowing in the sunset
by the river; the meadows were of an intense soft
green; the sky all fleecy and golden to the west, and
black with a great thundercloud over the woods to the
east, lit up with intermittent summer lightnings. The
mowers were all in different coloured shirts—scarlet,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>blue, white, and green. They mowed till the twilight
fell and the thundercloud got near to us. Then Feodor
came and made our cart into a tent by tying up the
shafts, putting a piece of matting across them, and
covering it with hay, and under this he made beds of
hay. We had supper. Feodor said his prayers, and
prepared to go to sleep, but changed his mind, got
up, and joined some friends in a neighbouring cart.</p>

<p class='c011'>Three children and a deaf and dumb peasant
remained with me. The peasants who were in the
neighbouring tent were drunk; they began by quarrelling,
then they sang for about four hours without
stopping; then they talked. Feodor came back about
half an hour before it was light, and slept for that brief
space. I did not sleep at all. I wasn’t tired, and the
singing was delightful to hear: so excessively characteristic
of Russia and so utterly unlike the music of
any other country, except that of Mongolia. What
strikes me most about it is in the first place the accuracy
with which the parts are taken, and in the second place
the curious rhythm, and the close, ending generally on
the dominant. The children chattered for some time
about mushroom gathering, and the deaf and dumb man
told me a lot by signs, and then they went to sleep.</p>

<p class='c011'>As soon as it was light the mowers all got up and
began mowing. I do not know which was the more
beautiful effect, that of the dusk or of the dawn. The
dawn was gray with pearly clouds and suffused with
the faintest pink tinge, and in the east the sun rose like
a great red ball with no clouds near it. At ten o’clock
we drove to an inn and had tea; then we drove back,
and the hay, although it was quite wet, for it had rained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>in the night, was carried there and then. “The women
dry it at home,” Feodor explained; “it’s too far for us
to come here twice.” The carts were laden with hay,
and I drove one of them home, lying on the top of the
hay, in my sleep. I had always envied the drivers of
carts whom one meets lying on a high load of hay, fast
asleep, and now I know from experience that there is
no such delicious slumber, with the kind sun warming
one through and through after a cold night, and the
slow jolting of the wagon rocking one, and the smell of
the hay acting like a soporific. Every now and then
one wakes up to see the world through a golden haze,
and then one falls back and drowns with pleasure in a
deep slumber of an inexpressibly delicious quality.</p>

<p class='c011'>When we re-crossed the river we again stopped for
tea. As we were standing outside an old woman passed
us, and just as she passed one of the peasants said to
me, “Sit down, Barine.” Barine, I suppose everybody
knows, means a <i><span lang="fr">monsieur</span></i>, in contradistinction to the
lower class. “Very like a Barine,” said the woman,
with a sarcastic snort, upon which the peasant told her
in the plainest and most uncomplimentary speech I
have ever heard exactly what he thought of her
personal appearance, her antecedents, and what she
was fit for. She passed on with dignity and in silence.
Then, after a time, I climbed up on the wagon again,
and sank back into my green paradise of dreams, and
remember nothing more till we arrived home at five
o’clock in the evening.</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>conflicting statements made by people in authority,
Government officials or Liberal leaders, as to what the
Russian people, the real people, are thinking and feeling,
it seemed to me that it would be worth while to put
aside theoretical speculations for a moment, and to try
to obtain some small fragments of first-hand evidence
with regard to what the people are saying and thinking.
With this object in view I have spent the last
four nights in the train between Moscow and St.
Petersburg. My field of observation was necessarily
small, but it cannot be called unrepresentative or
anti-national.</p>

<p class='c011'>The first thing which struck me was a small incident
which occurred at a railway station at Moscow, and has
a certain significance. I was engaging a cab, and near
me an officer was doing the same thing. The cabmen
were expressing reluctance to accept the officer’s terms,
and my cabman turned round to me and said: “That
man comes every day; he is drunk, and he drives and
drives, sometimes to the other end of the town, and
never pays a single kopeck.” “Why do you drive him
if he never pays you?” I asked. “There is nothing to
be done—he is an officer,” answered the cabman. This
is a small example of how the lawlessness of the existing
system of government in Russia affects the poorer
classes.</p>

<p class='c011'>I travelled from Moscow to St. Petersburg by a slow
train in a third-class carriage. In the carriage was a
mixed and representative assembly of people—a priest,
a merchant from Kursk, a photographer from Tchelabinsk,
a young volunteer: that is to say a young man
doing his year’s military service previous to becoming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>an officer, two minor public servants, an ex-soldier who
had been through the Turkish campaign, a soldier who
had lately returned from Manchuria, three peasants,
two Tartars, a small tradesman, a carpenter, and some
others. Besides these a whole band of gipsies (with
their children) encamped themselves on the platform
outside the carriage, and penetrated every now and
then into the carriage until they were driven out by
threats and curses.</p>

<p class='c011'>The first thing everybody did was to make themselves
thoroughly comfortable: to arrange mattresses
and pillows for the night; then they began to make
each other’s acquaintance. We had not travelled far
before the gipsies began to sing on the platform, and
this created some interest. They suggested fortune-telling,
but the ex-soldier shouted at them in a gruff
voice to begone. One of the officials had his fortune
told. The gipsy said she could do it much better for
five roubles (ten shillings) than for a few kopecks,
which he had given. I had my fortune told, which
consisted in a hurried rigmarole to the effect that I
was often blamed, but never blamed others; that I
could only work if I was my own master, and that
I would shortly experience a great change of fortune.
The gipsy added that if I could give her five roubles
she would tie a piece of bark in my handkerchief
which, with the addition of a little bread and salt,
would render me immune from danger. The gipsies
soon got out. The journey went on uneventfully—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Le moine disait son bréviaire,</div>
      <div class='line'>La femme chantait,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>as in La Fontaine’s fable. We had supper and tea,
and the ex-soldier related the experiences of his life,
saying he had travelled much and seen the world (he
was a Cossack by birth), and was not merely a <i><span lang="fr">Moujik</span></i>.
This offended one of the peasants, a bearded man, who
walked up from his place and grunted in protest, and
then walked back again.</p>

<p class='c011'>They began to talk politics. The Cossack was asked
his opinion on the attitude of the Cossacks. He said
their attitude had changed, and that they objected to
police service. The photographer from Tchelabinsk
corroborated this statement, saying he had been present
at a Cossack meeting in Siberia. Then we had a short
concert. The photographer produced a mandoline and
played tunes. All the inmates of the carriage gathered
round him. One of the peasants said: “Although I am
an ignorant man” (it was the peasant who had grunted)
“I could see at once that he wasn’t simply playing with
his fingers, but with something else” (the tortoiseshell
that twangs the mandoline). He asked the photographer
how much a mandoline cost. On being told
thirty roubles he said he would give thirty roubles to be
able to play as well as that. Somebody, by way of
appreciation, put a cigarette into the mouth of the
photographer as he was playing.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then I went to bed in the next compartment; but
not to sleep, because a carpenter, who had the bed
opposite mine, told me the whole story of his life
which was extremely melancholy. The volunteer
appeared later; he had been educated in the Cadet-Corps,
and I asked him if he would soon be an officer.
“I will never be an officer,” he answered; “I don’t want
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>to be one <em>now</em>.” I asked him if a statement I had read
in the newspapers was true to the effect that several
officers had telegraphed to the Government that unless
they were relieved of police duty they would resign.
He said it was quite true; that general discontent prevailed
among officers; that the life was getting unbearable;
that they were looked down upon by the rest of
the people, and besides this they were ordered about
from one place to another. He liked the officers whom
he was with very much, but they were sick of the whole
thing. Then towards one in the morning I got a little
sleep. As soon as it was daylight everybody was up,
making tea and busily discussing politics. The priest
and the tradesman were having a discussion about the
Duma, and every one else, including the guard, was
joining in.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you understand what the Duma was?” said the
tradesman; “the Duma was simply the people. Do
you know what all that talk of a movement of liberation
means? It means simply this: that we want
control, responsibility. That if you are to get or to
pay five roubles or fifty roubles you will get or pay
five roubles or fifty roubles, not more and not less, and
that nobody will have the right to interfere; and that if
some one interferes he will be responsible. The first
thing the Duma asked for was a responsible Ministry,
and the reason why it was dissolved is that the
Government would not give that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The priest said that he approved of a Duma, but
unless men changed themselves no change of government
was of any use. “Man must change inwardly,”
he said.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>“I believe in God,” answered the tradesman, “but it
is written in the Scripture that God said: ‘Take the
earth and cultivate it,’ and that is what we have got to
do; to make the best of this earth. When we die we
shall go to Heaven, and then”—he spoke in a practical
tone of voice which settled the matter—“then we shall
have to do with God.” The priest took out his Bible
and found a passage in the Gospel. “This revolutionary
movement will go on,” he said, “nothing can stop it
now; but, mark my words, we shall see oceans of blood
shed first, and this prophecy will come true,” and he
read the text about one stone not being left on another.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then they discussed the priesthood and the part
played by priests. “The priests play an abominable
part,” said the tradesman; “they are worse than
murderers. A murderer is a man who goes and kills
some one. He is not so bad as the man who stays
at home and tells others to kill. That is what the
priests do.” He then mentioned a monk who had
preached against the Jews in the South of Russia.
“I call that man the greatest criminal, because he
stirred up the peasants’ blood, and they went to kill
the Jews. Lots of peasants cease to go to church and
say their prayers at home because of this. When the
Cossacks come to beat them, the priests tell them that
they are sent by God. Do you believe they are sent by
God?” he asked, turning to the bearded peasant.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No,” answered the peasant; “I think they are sent
by the devil.” The priest said that the universal
dominion of the Jews was at hand. The tradesman
contested this, and said that in Russia the Jews
assimilated themselves to the people more than in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>other countries. “The Jews are cunning,” said the
priest; “the Russians are in a ditch, and they go to
the Jews and say: ‘Pull us out.’” “If that is true,”
said the tradesman, “we ought to put up a gold statue
to the Jews for pulling us out of the ditch. Look at
the time of the <i><span lang="fr">pogroms</span></i>, the rich Russians ran away,
but the richest Jews stayed behind.” “They are clever;
they knew their business. If they stayed you may be
sure they gained something by it,” said the merchant
from Kursk. “But we ought to be clever, too,” said
the tradesman, “and try and imitate their self-sacrifice.
Look at the Duma. There were twenty Jews in the
Duma, but they did not bring forward the question of
equal rights for the Jews before anything else as they
might have done. It is criminal for the priests to attack
the Jews, and if they go on like this the people will leave
them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Whereas,” said the merchant from Kursk thoughtfully,
“if they supported the people the people would
never desert them.” “The priests,” said one of the
other nondescript people, “say that Catherine the
Second is a goddess; and for that reason her descendants
have a hundred thousand acres. General Trepoff
will be canonised when he dies, and his bones will work
miracles.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The guard joined in here, and told his grievances at
great length. They discussed the assassinations of
Hertzenstein and Admiral Chouchnin. “Hertzenstein
never did any one any harm,” some one said;
“Chouchnin condemned hundreds and hundreds of
people to death.”</p>

<p class='c011'>At one of the stations a fresh influx of people came,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>among others an old peasant and a young man in a
blouse. The old peasant complained of the times.
“Formerly we all had enough to eat; now there is
not enough,” he said. “People are clever now. When
I was a lad, if I did not obey my grandfather immediately
he used to box my ears; now my son is
surprised because I don’t obey him. People have all
become clever, and the result is we have got nothing
to eat.” The young man said the Government was
to blame for most things. “That’s a difficult question
to be clear about. How can we be clear about it?
We know nothing,” said the old peasant. “You ought
to try and know, or else things will never get better,”
said the young man. “I don’t want to listen to a
<em>Barine</em> like you,” said the old peasant. “I’m not a
<em>Barine</em>, I am a peasant, even as thou art,” said the
young man. “Nonsense,” said the old peasant.</p>

<p class='c011'>The discussion was then cut short by our arrival at
St. Petersburg.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>
  <h2 class='c009'>CONCLUSION</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>This book admits of no real conclusion, since its
sole object is to throw a few sidelights on a
struggle which is still going on, and which is possibly
still in its infancy. My experience of it so far leads me
to believe that there are only two sides in this struggle
(although at first sight it appears to be infinitely more
complicated), and that these two sides are the same
which have split up all countries in all times under
various names such as Roundheads and Cavaliers, or
Reds and Whites.</p>

<p class='c011'>In Russia the two classes are the defenders and the
opponents of the Government, or rather of the autocracy.
The former base their contentions on the affirmation
that Russia is an Oriental country and that Western
institutions are unsuited to the Russian people. Parenthetically,
I must mention that I am not alluding to
the extreme reactionaries—to those people who wish
to go back to institutions which existed before the time
of Peter the Great. I am referring to intelligent people
who, while belonging to no political parties, simply
disbelieve in the Liberal movement in Russia, consider
it to be the hysterical cackling of an unimportant
minority, and think that the whole matter is mere stuff
and nonsense. The opinion of these people is certainly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>worth considering, not because they are more impartial
than others who belong to parties, since their ideas are
equally based upon prejudice, but because they may be
right. These people say that all talk of a Constitution
is beside the mark. They argue thus:</p>

<p class='c011'>“We must have a Constitution, just as we have an
Army and a Navy, because the idea soothes the
revolution-haunted breasts of foreign financiers, but we
shall never have a real Constitution because we don’t
want one. Reforms? Oh, yes, as many as you please,
on paper, signed and countersigned, but they will
remain a dead letter, because they are not adapted
to the character and the spirit of the nation. You
cannot force Russian peasants to own land in the way
Western peasants do. You can make laws telling
them to do so, but if you force them you will only
drive them to rebellion. Russia is like China; you can
draw up a Constitution for Russia, but when it is carried
out you will find that the only practical difference
between the old state of affairs and the new is that
the writing-table of the Minister of Foreign Affairs is to
be oblong instead of round. People say that the
Russian people is good and that its Government is bad,
but the faults of the people are not the result of the
inherent vices of the Government; the vices of the
Government are the logical result of the faults, which in
their turn are the inevitable complement of the good
qualities, of the people. The desire for Liberal reforms
based on Western examples is merely a fictitious
agitation of a minority, namely, the ‘Intelligenzia’ or
middle class, who have forgotten and lost their native
traditions and instincts and have adopted and not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>properly assimilated the traditions and instincts of
Western Europe. They have ceased to be Russian,
and they have not become European. They have
taken the European banner of ideals, but they do not
know what to do with it; they cannot hold it up in
their weak Slav hands. The result is words, words,
words. This chatter will continue for a time, and when
people get tired of listening, it will cease. As for
the people, the real people, they will settle their affairs
with those immediately connected with them, with their
landlords, &#38;c. The Government will make plenty of
reforms on paper and have a Duma; but everything
will go on exactly as it was before. Because you
cannot change the character of a people, and the form
of government they enjoy is the result and the expression
of their qualities and of their defects.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Such are the arguments I have often heard advanced
by these people, and I say once more that they may be
right. Three years ago I was firmly convinced that
they were right, and even now I have an open mind on
the subject, although two years of close contact with
Russians of all classes have led me to change my own
opinion, and to agree with the other equally impartial
people, who are just as Russian and have just as
much knowledge of the country and experience of their
fellow countrymen, and who flatly deny the whole thing.
According to this school, the comparison with China is
wrong because the Chinese are intellectually a highly
civilised nation, and the proportion of them who can
read and write is large. The present <i><span lang="fr">régime</span></i> in Russia is
not the natural expression of national characteristics,
but a fortuitous disease which has been allowed to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>spread without ever having been radically treated.
Neither Autocracy nor Bureaucracy is a thing which
has grown out of the immemorial traditions and habits
of the Russian people; Autocracy was the product of
a comparatively recent change in Russian history, and
Bureaucracy the accidental result of the further changes
introduced by a man of genius. The Government made
certain things impossible: such as education for the
peasants, laws for the peasants, justice, &#38;c.; then, when
the results of these prohibitions began to make themselves
felt, turned round and said: “You see what these
men are like; it is no use giving them anything
because they are hopeless; they are like niggers and
must be treated as such.” This has been the proceeding
of the Government: to prevent, prevent, and prevent
again; and then, when the explosion resulting from the
prevention occurred, to observe how right they had been
in preventing, and how necessary it was to prevent
more and more, because it was the only thing the
people understood. In this blindness and obstinacy,
year after year deferring the payment of their debt,
they have let the interest accumulate; and when they
eventually have to pay, far more will be required of
them than they need originally have surrendered.</p>

<p class='c011'>The people who represent these two schools of
thought both say that they are Russia. They assert:
“We are Russia—tout le reste est littérature.” Only
time can show which is right. I have noticed that with
the representatives of both these schools the wish is
father to the thought and that they generalise on their
own desires and their own experience coloured by those
desires. Which really represents Russia, we shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>know perhaps in ten years’ time. As far as my own
experience goes among peasants, workmen, &#38;c., they
have all been representatives of the second school. But
then, the first school would say that this is immaterial,
because the people may be thirsty for law, and yet
incapable of drinking it.</p>

<p class='c011'>But those who belong to the second school, and
without following any party are liberal in thought
and deed, say to their opponents: “If it is true that
what you represent is really Russia, we have no further
wish to remain Russians, and the day you are proved
to be in the right, we will emigrate and settle in Turkey,
in Persia, or in China.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>The Standard Library</span> is a new series of volumes containing the great classics of the
world, and particularly the finest works of English literature. All the great masters will be
represented, either in complete works or in selections. It is the ambition of the publishers to
place the best books of the Anglo-Saxon race within the reach of every reader, so that the
series may represent something of the diversity and splendour of our English tongue. The
characteristics of <span class='sc'>The Standard Library</span> are four:—1. <span class='sc'>Soundness of Text.</span> 2. <span class='sc'>Cheapness.</span>
3. <span class='sc'>Clearness of Type.</span> 4. <span class='sc'>Simplicity.</span> The books are well printed on good paper at a
price which on the whole is without parallel in the history of publishing. Each volume contains
from 100 to 250 pages, and is issued in paper covers, Crown 8vo, at Sixpence net, or in
cloth gilt at One Shilling net. In a few cases long books are issued as Double Volumes
or as Treble Volumes.</p>

<p class='c011'>Encouraged by the great and steady sale of their Sixpenny Novels, Messrs. Methuen have
determined to issue a new series of fiction at a low price under the title of ‘<span class='sc'>The Shilling
Novels</span>.’ These books are well printed and well bound in <em>cloth</em>, and the excellence of their
quality may be gauged from the names of those authors who contribute the early volumes of
the series.</p>

<p class='c011'>Messrs. Methuen would point out that the books are as good and as long as a six shilling
novel, that they are bound in cloth and not in paper, and that their price is One Shilling <em>net</em>.
They feel sure that the public will appreciate such good and cheap literature, and the books can
be seen at all good booksellers.</p>
